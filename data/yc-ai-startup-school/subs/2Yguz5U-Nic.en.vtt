00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
I think that we will continue to see

foundational data sources in order to do
this.<00:26:15.360><c> And</c><00:26:15.520><c> I</c><00:26:15.679><c> think</c><00:26:15.760><c> the</c><00:26:16.000><c> other</c><00:26:16.240><c> thing</c><00:26:16.960><c> that</c>

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
this. And I think the other thing that
 

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
this. And I think the other thing that
has<00:26:17.520><c> really</c><00:26:18.080><c> been</c><00:26:18.320><c> a</c><00:26:18.559><c> property</c><00:26:19.600><c> is</c><00:26:19.840><c> that</c><00:26:20.480><c> you</c>

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
has really been a property is that you
 

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
has really been a property is that you
start<00:26:20.960><c> where</c><00:26:21.279><c> you</c><00:26:21.440><c> have</c><00:26:21.600><c> data</c><00:26:22.240><c> but</c><00:26:22.480><c> then</c><00:26:22.640><c> you</c>

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
start where you have data but then you
 

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
start where you have data but then you
find<00:26:23.200><c> what</c><00:26:23.440><c> problems</c><00:26:23.840><c> it</c><00:26:24.080><c> can</c><00:26:24.240><c> be</c><00:26:24.320><c> applied</c><00:26:24.720><c> to.</c>

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
find what problems it can be applied to.
 

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.630 align:start position:0%
find what problems it can be applied to.
And<00:26:26.080><c> so</c><00:26:26.240><c> we</c><00:26:26.559><c> find</c><00:26:27.039><c> enormous</c><00:26:27.600><c> advance,</c>

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
And so we find enormous advance,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.110 align:start position:0%

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is really where we see the

this is really where we see the
