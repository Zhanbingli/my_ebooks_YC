then maybe it would you know you could
 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
then maybe it would you know you could

teach it to play fetch and things like

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
that. Uh that idea really animated us.
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
that. Uh that idea really animated us.
But<00:03:40.640><c> we</c><00:03:40.879><c> had</c><00:03:40.959><c> no</c><00:03:41.200><c> idea</c><00:03:41.360><c> how</c><00:03:41.519><c> to</c><00:03:41.680><c> build</c><00:03:41.840><c> it.</c><00:03:42.319><c> And</c>

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.229 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:42.799><c> again</c><00:03:43.120><c> you</c><00:03:43.280><c> know</c><00:03:43.519><c> started</c><00:03:43.840><c> the</c><00:03:44.080><c> place</c>

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
so again you know started the place
 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.589 align:start position:0%

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
So you like implemented your own neural
 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.870 align:start position:0%
So you like implemented your own neural

Yeah.<00:05:13.199><c> So</c>

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
Yeah. So
 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
Yeah. So
when<00:05:13.680><c> you</c><00:05:13.840><c> were</c><00:05:14.000><c> like</c><00:05:14.160><c> I</c><00:05:14.400><c> don't</c><00:05:14.479><c> know</c><00:05:14.720><c> 16</c><00:05:15.360><c> 17</c>

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
when you were like I don't know 16 17
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
when you were like I don't know 16 17
the<00:05:16.240><c> constraints</c><00:05:16.639><c> of</c><00:05:16.720><c> the</c><00:05:16.880><c> problem</c><00:05:17.120><c> were</c><00:05:17.759><c> we</c>

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the constraints of the problem were we
 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
the constraints of the problem were we
were<00:05:18.160><c> dealing</c><00:05:18.479><c> with</c><00:05:19.360><c> uh</c><00:05:19.520><c> robots</c><00:05:20.000><c> and</c><00:05:20.240><c> so</c><00:05:20.400><c> we</c>

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
were dealing with uh robots and so we
 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.629 align:start position:0%
were dealing with uh robots and so we
were<00:05:20.720><c> dealing</c><00:05:20.880><c> with</c><00:05:21.120><c> microcontrollers</c>

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
were dealing with microcontrollers
 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.150 align:start position:0%
were dealing with microcontrollers
um<00:05:22.720><c> and</c><00:05:22.880><c> so</c><00:05:23.120><c> microcontrollers</c><00:05:23.840><c> have</c><00:05:24.000><c> very</c>

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
um and so microcontrollers have very
 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.749 align:start position:0%
um and so microcontrollers have very
little<00:05:24.320><c> memory</c><00:05:24.880><c> and</c><00:05:25.120><c> they</c><00:05:25.360><c> couldn't</c><00:05:25.600><c> really</c>

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
bunch of work there. Also the training
 

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
bunch of work there. Also the training
infrastructure<00:08:38.080><c> for</c><00:08:38.399><c> doing</c><00:08:38.640><c> any</c><00:08:39.039><c> kind</c><00:08:39.200><c> of</c>

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for doing any kind of
modeling<00:08:39.680><c> work</c><00:08:39.839><c> back</c><00:08:40.000><c> then</c><00:08:40.159><c> was</c><00:08:40.320><c> pretty</c>

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
modeling work back then was pretty
 

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.790 align:start position:0%
modeling work back then was pretty
rudimentary<00:08:41.839><c> and</c><00:08:42.080><c> so</c><00:08:42.320><c> there</c><00:08:42.479><c> was</c><00:08:42.560><c> a</c><00:08:42.640><c> lot</c><00:08:42.719><c> of</c>

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
rudimentary and so there was a lot of
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.310 align:start position:0%
rudimentary and so there was a lot of

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
work on the on the infra side there and
 

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
work on the on the infra side there and
just<00:08:44.480><c> a</c><00:08:44.640><c> lot</c><00:08:44.720><c> of</c><00:08:44.800><c> experimenting</c><00:08:45.360><c> with</c><00:08:45.519><c> models</c>

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
we were building an extension these

were<00:08:58.399><c> working</c><00:08:58.560><c> on</c><00:08:58.800><c> an</c><00:08:59.040><c> endtoend</c><00:08:59.440><c> encrypted</c>

were working on an endtoend encrypted

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.430 align:start position:0%

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
idea was not working? It's like, oh no,
 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
idea was not working? It's like, oh no,
we<00:09:48.320><c> we're</c><00:09:48.720><c> all</c><00:09:48.959><c> working</c><00:09:49.120><c> on</c><00:09:49.360><c> this.</c><00:09:49.839><c> We</c><00:09:50.080><c> we're</c>

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
we we're all working on this. We we're
 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.750 align:start position:0%
we we're all working on this. We we're
trying<00:09:50.640><c> to</c><00:09:50.800><c> do</c><00:09:50.880><c> the</c><00:09:51.040><c> startup.</c><00:09:51.440><c> It's</c><00:09:51.600><c> not</c>

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do the startup. It's not
 

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
trying to do the startup. It's not
working.<00:09:52.320><c> And</c>

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
working. And
 

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
working. And
what<00:09:54.560><c> was</c><00:09:54.720><c> that</c><00:09:54.880><c> moment</c><00:09:55.360><c> like?</c>

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
what was that moment like?
 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.269 align:start position:0%
what was that moment like?
I<00:09:56.160><c> think</c><00:09:56.240><c> it</c><00:09:56.399><c> was</c><00:09:56.480><c> a</c><00:09:56.640><c> bit</c><00:09:56.800><c> different</c><00:09:56.959><c> for</c><00:09:57.120><c> each</c>

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
I think it was a bit different for each
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
I think it was a bit different for each
of<00:09:57.360><c> the</c><00:09:57.600><c> projects.</c><00:09:58.000><c> I</c><00:09:58.160><c> think</c><00:09:58.240><c> for</c><00:09:58.959><c> the</c>

00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
of the projects. I think for the
 

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.509 align:start position:0%
of the projects. I think for the

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
co-founders worked on. It was really
 

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
co-founders worked on. It was really

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
technically impressive, but it had these
 

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
technically impressive, but it had these
bad<00:10:05.519><c> trade-offs</c><00:10:06.080><c> where</c><00:10:06.240><c> it</c><00:10:06.399><c> wasn't</c><00:10:06.640><c> very</c>

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
bad trade-offs where it wasn't very
 

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
bad trade-offs where it wasn't very
scalable.<00:10:07.920><c> And</c><00:10:08.160><c> I</c><00:10:08.399><c> think</c><00:10:08.480><c> they</c><00:10:08.640><c> tried</c><00:10:08.800><c> to</c><00:10:08.880><c> give</c>

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
scalable. And I think they tried to give
 

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.150 align:start position:0%
scalable. And I think they tried to give
it<00:10:09.120><c> to</c><00:10:09.279><c> people</c><00:10:09.440><c> and</c><00:10:09.600><c> it</c><00:10:09.760><c> didn't</c><00:10:09.920><c> really</c><00:10:10.000><c> work.</c>

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
it to people and it didn't really work.
 

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
it to people and it didn't really work.
And<00:10:10.320><c> then</c><00:10:10.399><c> they</c><00:10:10.480><c> tried</c><00:10:10.640><c> to</c><00:10:10.720><c> sell</c><00:10:10.800><c> it</c><00:10:10.880><c> B2B</c><00:10:11.279><c> and</c>

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
And then they tried to sell it B2B and
 

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.870 align:start position:0%
And then they tried to sell it B2B and
then<00:10:11.519><c> it</c><00:10:11.680><c> didn't</c><00:10:11.839><c> really</c><00:10:11.920><c> work.</c><00:10:12.160><c> And</c><00:10:12.640><c> I</c><00:10:12.800><c> think</c>

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
then it didn't really work. And I think
 

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
then it didn't really work. And I think
it<00:10:13.040><c> was</c><00:10:13.200><c> after</c><00:10:13.360><c> a</c><00:10:13.519><c> couple</c><00:10:13.680><c> of</c><00:10:13.760><c> months</c><00:10:13.920><c> of</c>

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
it was after a couple of months of
 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.710 align:start position:0%
it was after a couple of months of
trying<00:10:14.160><c> to</c><00:10:14.240><c> get</c><00:10:14.399><c> traction</c><00:10:14.959><c> for</c><00:10:15.360><c> the</c><00:10:16.320><c> CAD</c>

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.829 align:start position:0%

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
ideas. It was yeah many months of trying
 

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
ideas. It was yeah many months of trying

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
to get the models to really be useful
 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.310 align:start position:0%

um for end users and then also reckoning
around<00:10:24.880><c> are</c><00:10:25.120><c> we</c><00:10:25.279><c> really</c><00:10:25.519><c> interested</c><00:10:25.760><c> in</c><00:10:25.920><c> these</c>

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
around are we really interested in these
 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
around are we really interested in these
areas<00:10:26.480><c> or</c><00:10:26.640><c> is</c><00:10:26.800><c> there</c><00:10:27.040><c> something</c><00:10:27.200><c> else</c><00:10:27.360><c> that</c>

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
areas or is there something else that
 

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.190 align:start position:0%
areas or is there something else that
we're<00:10:28.079><c> inherently</c><00:10:28.560><c> much</c><00:10:28.800><c> more</c><00:10:28.959><c> excited</c>

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're inherently much more excited
 

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
we're inherently much more excited
about.

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
about.
 

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.790 align:start position:0%
about.
So<00:10:29.680><c> there</c><00:10:29.839><c> was</c><00:10:29.920><c> a</c><00:10:30.000><c> moment</c><00:10:30.240><c> that</c><00:10:30.399><c> you</c><00:10:30.399><c> decided</c>

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
So there was a moment that you decided
 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
So there was a moment that you decided
okay<00:10:31.040><c> these</c><00:10:31.360><c> ideas</c><00:10:31.600><c> are</c><00:10:31.839><c> not</c><00:10:32.000><c> working</c><00:10:32.320><c> we</c><00:10:32.480><c> have</c>

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay these ideas are not working we have
 

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
okay these ideas are not working we have
to<00:10:32.800><c> pivot</c><00:10:33.120><c> again.</c>

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
to pivot again.
 

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
to pivot again.
Yes.<00:10:34.720><c> you</c><00:10:34.880><c> you</c><00:10:35.120><c> you</c><00:10:35.360><c> turned</c><00:10:35.600><c> through</c><00:10:35.839><c> a</c><00:10:36.959><c> three</c>

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
Yes. you you you turned through a three
 

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
Yes. you you you turned through a three
ideas,<00:10:37.680><c> three,</c><00:10:37.920><c> four,</c><00:10:38.160><c> five</c><00:10:38.320><c> ideas</c><00:10:38.880><c> before</c>

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
ideas, three, four, five ideas before
 

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.949 align:start position:0%
ideas, three, four, five ideas before
landing<00:10:39.760><c> into</c><00:10:40.959><c> into</c><00:10:41.680><c> uh</c><00:10:41.920><c> code</c><00:10:42.240><c> completion.</c>

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
landing into into uh code completion.
 

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
landing into into uh code completion.
Yeah,<00:10:43.120><c> I</c><00:10:43.360><c> think</c><00:10:43.440><c> that</c><00:10:44.079><c> um</c><00:10:44.240><c> so</c><00:10:44.399><c> we</c><00:10:44.640><c> had</c><00:10:44.800><c> been</c>

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I think that um so we had been
 

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.829 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I think that um so we had been
inspired<00:10:45.360><c> by</c><00:10:46.399><c> um</c><00:10:46.800><c> tools</c><00:10:47.040><c> like</c><00:10:47.200><c> copilot</c><00:10:47.680><c> really</c>

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
inspired by um tools like copilot really
 

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:50.790 align:start position:0%
inspired by um tools like copilot really
early<00:10:48.079><c> on</c><00:10:48.959><c> um</c><00:10:49.200><c> and</c><00:10:49.680><c> we</c><00:10:49.839><c> had</c><00:10:50.000><c> avoided</c><00:10:50.480><c> working</c>

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
early on um and we had avoided working
 

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
early on um and we had avoided working
on<00:10:51.839><c> um</c><00:10:52.160><c> AI</c><00:10:52.560><c> and</c><00:10:52.800><c> coding</c><00:10:53.200><c> because</c><00:10:53.440><c> we</c><00:10:53.680><c> thought</c>

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
on um AI and coding because we thought
 

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
on um AI and coding because we thought
it<00:10:54.000><c> was</c><00:10:54.079><c> too</c><00:10:54.320><c> competitive</c><00:10:55.200><c> competitive</c><00:10:55.600><c> then</c>

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
it was too competitive competitive then
 

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
it was too competitive competitive then
still<00:10:56.160><c> is</c><00:10:56.399><c> competitive</c><00:10:56.800><c> now.</c><00:10:57.120><c> So</c>

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
still is competitive now. So
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
still is competitive now. So
2022<00:10:59.600><c> GitHub</c><00:10:59.920><c> copilot</c><00:11:00.399><c> was</c><00:11:00.560><c> making</c><00:11:00.800><c> already</c>

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
2022 GitHub copilot was making already
 

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
2022 GitHub copilot was making already
about<00:11:01.360><c> 100</c><00:11:01.600><c> million</c><00:11:01.920><c> revenue</c>

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
about 100 million revenue
 

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
about 100 million revenue
I<00:11:02.720><c> think</c><00:11:03.040><c> or</c><00:11:03.200><c> more</c>

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
I think or more
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.389 align:start position:0%
I think or more
potentially<00:11:03.839><c> more.</c><00:11:04.160><c> Yeah.</c>

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're aiming for. And we realized we
 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
you're aiming for. And we realized we

were really inherently excited about the

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
see how some of the other people in the

see how some of the other people in the

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%

space were, you know, working on their

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.790 align:start position:0%
products. We got to see how the tech was
developing.<00:11:35.760><c> And</c><00:11:35.920><c> I</c><00:11:36.160><c> think</c><00:11:36.240><c> we</c><00:11:36.399><c> took</c><00:11:36.480><c> a</c><00:11:36.640><c> step</c>

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
developing. And I think we took a step

Yeah. And we had the fear of God in us.
I<00:14:31.360><c> mean</c><00:14:31.440><c> we</c><00:14:31.600><c> had</c>

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%

doing none of that. And then over the

a bunch of people using the product. And
then<00:17:21.360><c> that</c><00:17:21.520><c> also</c><00:17:21.679><c> gives</c><00:17:21.839><c> you</c><00:17:22.000><c> the</c><00:17:22.160><c> ability</c><00:17:22.400><c> to</c>

then that also gives you the ability to

then that also gives you the ability to

was going to be a thing, right? You were

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
whether you should still pivot. It's
 

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
whether you should still pivot. It's

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
like, oh, is this idea still going to
work?<00:17:56.000><c> And</c><00:17:56.480><c> you</c><00:17:56.720><c> were</c><00:17:56.799><c> still</c><00:17:56.960><c> trying</c><00:17:57.200><c> to</c><00:17:57.360><c> grow</c>

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
work? And you were still trying to grow
 

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.029 align:start position:0%
work? And you were still trying to grow
it,<00:17:57.760><c> right?</c><00:17:58.000><c> Because</c><00:17:58.080><c> it</c><00:17:58.240><c> took</c><00:17:58.480><c> a</c><00:17:58.640><c> long</c><00:17:58.799><c> time</c>

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
it, right? Because it took a long time
 

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
it, right? Because it took a long time
to<00:17:59.200><c> to</c><00:17:59.600><c> get</c><00:17:59.840><c> to</c><00:18:00.720><c> revenue,</c><00:18:01.280><c> right?</c>

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
to to get to revenue, right?
 

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
to to get to revenue, right?
Yeah.<00:18:01.919><c> I</c><00:18:02.160><c> think</c><00:18:02.240><c> that</c><00:18:02.720><c> over</c><00:18:03.039><c> 2023</c><00:18:03.840><c> it</c><00:18:04.720><c> uh</c><00:18:04.799><c> it</c>

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
Yeah. I think that over 2023 it uh it
 

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
Yeah. I think that over 2023 it uh it
was<00:18:05.200><c> growing</c><00:18:06.320><c> the</c><00:18:06.559><c> numbers</c><00:18:06.799><c> were</c><00:18:06.960><c> kind</c><00:18:07.120><c> of</c>

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
was growing the numbers were kind of
 

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.029 align:start position:0%
was growing the numbers were kind of
small<00:18:07.520><c> and</c><00:18:07.919><c> I</c><00:18:08.160><c> think</c><00:18:08.240><c> that</c><00:18:08.400><c> also</c><00:18:08.720><c> we</c><00:18:08.880><c> were</c>

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
small and I think that also we were
 

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:11.029 align:start position:0%
small and I think that also we were
working<00:18:09.200><c> on</c><00:18:09.440><c> something</c><00:18:09.760><c> where</c><00:18:10.400><c> there</c><00:18:10.720><c> wasn't</c>

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
working on something where there wasn't
 

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
working on something where there wasn't
always<00:18:11.200><c> a</c><00:18:11.440><c> clear</c><00:18:11.679><c> next</c><00:18:11.919><c> step.</c><00:18:12.559><c> Um</c><00:18:12.880><c> I</c><00:18:13.120><c> think</c>

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
always a clear next step. Um I think
 

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.549 align:start position:0%
always a clear next step. Um I think
that<00:18:13.360><c> there</c><00:18:13.520><c> are</c><00:18:13.760><c> probably</c><00:18:14.080><c> some</c><00:18:14.320><c> markets</c>

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
that there are probably some markets
 

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:17.430 align:start position:0%
that there are probably some markets
where<00:18:14.720><c> you're</c><00:18:14.960><c> really</c><00:18:15.120><c> well</c><00:18:15.280><c> served</c><00:18:15.679><c> by</c>

where you're really well served by
 

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
where you're really well served by

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
kind of be the direct solution and then
 

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.909 align:start position:0%
kind of be the direct solution and then

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
there. Um, but I think that we were and
 

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.870 align:start position:0%

that<00:18:48.720><c> you</c><00:18:48.880><c> could</c><00:18:48.960><c> write</c><00:18:49.120><c> down</c><00:18:49.360><c> that</c><00:18:49.520><c> that</c>

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
that you could write down that that
 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.029 align:start position:0%
that you could write down that that
would<00:18:50.000><c> be</c><00:18:50.080><c> useful</c><00:18:50.320><c> if</c><00:18:50.480><c> you</c><00:18:50.559><c> could</c><00:18:50.720><c> build</c><00:18:50.880><c> them,</c>

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
would be useful if you could build them,
 

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
would be useful if you could build them,
but<00:18:51.280><c> then,</c><00:18:51.440><c> you</c><00:18:51.520><c> know,</c><00:18:51.679><c> figuring</c><00:18:52.000><c> out</c><00:18:52.799><c> how</c><00:18:52.960><c> to</c>

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
but then, you know, figuring out how to
 

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.669 align:start position:0%
but then, you know, figuring out how to
build<00:18:53.360><c> them</c><00:18:53.520><c> and</c><00:18:53.919><c> all</c><00:18:54.160><c> the</c><00:18:54.320><c> details.</c><00:18:55.280><c> It's</c><00:18:55.440><c> not</c>

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
build them and all the details. It's not
 

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:57.029 align:start position:0%
build them and all the details. It's not

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.789 align:start position:0%
that. And so yeah, there were a lot of

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.630 align:start position:0%

you<00:19:00.960><c> know</c><00:19:01.120><c> actually</c><00:19:01.280><c> also</c><00:19:01.520><c> to</c><00:19:01.679><c> add</c><00:19:01.840><c> to</c><00:19:02.000><c> this</c><00:19:02.400><c> of</c>

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
was a lot of early prototyping and uh
 

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
was a lot of early prototyping and uh

00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
was a a bit more than that, but sort of
 

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
was a a bit more than that, but sort of
roughly<00:19:59.520><c> that</c><00:19:59.600><c> that</c>

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
roughly that that
 

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.430 align:start position:0%
roughly that that
And<00:20:00.880><c> then</c><00:20:01.120><c> 2024</c><00:20:01.840><c> was</c><00:20:02.080><c> a</c><00:20:02.400><c> crazy</c><00:20:02.799><c> year.</c><00:20:03.120><c> You</c><00:20:03.280><c> guys</c>

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
And then 2024 was a crazy year. You guys
 

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.630 align:start position:0%
And then 2024 was a crazy year. You guys
went<00:20:03.679><c> from</c><00:20:04.080><c> one</c><00:20:04.480><c> to</c><00:20:04.720><c> 100</c><00:20:05.120><c> million</c>

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
went from one to 100 million
 

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
went from one to 100 million
in<00:20:06.960><c> one</c><00:20:07.280><c> year.</c><00:20:07.760><c> Tell</c><00:20:07.919><c> us</c><00:20:08.080><c> about</c><00:20:08.240><c> this</c><00:20:08.559><c> uh</c><00:20:08.799><c> loss</c>

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
in one year. Tell us about this uh loss
 

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
in one year. Tell us about this uh loss
of<00:20:09.440><c> uh</c><00:20:09.679><c> compounding</c><00:20:10.160><c> power</c><00:20:10.480><c> because</c><00:20:10.720><c> you</c><00:20:10.960><c> kept</c>

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
of uh compounding power because you kept
 

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.430 align:start position:0%
of uh compounding power because you kept
that<00:20:11.440><c> growing</c><00:20:11.760><c> 10%</c><00:20:12.240><c> week</c><00:20:12.480><c> over</c><00:20:12.720><c> week.</c><00:20:13.120><c> How</c><00:20:13.360><c> did</c>

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
that growing 10% week over week. How did
 

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
that growing 10% week over week. How did
that<00:20:13.679><c> happen?</c>

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
that happen?
 

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
that happen?
So,<00:20:14.400><c> the</c><00:20:14.559><c> numbers</c><00:20:14.799><c> felt</c><00:20:15.039><c> small</c><00:20:15.280><c> early</c><00:20:15.520><c> on,</c>

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
So, the numbers felt small early on,
 

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
So, the numbers felt small early on,
then<00:20:15.919><c> the</c><00:20:16.080><c> compounding</c><00:20:16.559><c> kind</c><00:20:16.720><c> of</c><00:20:16.799><c> kept</c><00:20:17.039><c> going.</c>

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
then the compounding kind of kept going.
 

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
then the compounding kind of kept going.
I<00:20:17.840><c> think</c><00:20:17.919><c> that</c><00:20:18.080><c> there</c><00:20:18.240><c> were</c><00:20:18.400><c> a</c><00:20:18.559><c> couple</c><00:20:18.720><c> of</c>

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
I think that there were a couple of
 

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
I think that there were a couple of
things<00:20:19.840><c> that</c><00:20:20.480><c> really</c><00:20:20.799><c> drove</c><00:20:21.120><c> our</c><00:20:21.360><c> growth.</c><00:20:22.000><c> Um,</c>

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
things that really drove our growth. Um,
 

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.630 align:start position:0%
things that really drove our growth. Um,
we're<00:20:22.559><c> in</c><00:20:22.720><c> this</c><00:20:23.039><c> market</c><00:20:23.600><c> where</c><00:20:24.160><c> if</c><00:20:24.320><c> you</c><00:20:24.480><c> make</c>

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're in this market where if you make
 

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.230 align:start position:0%
we're in this market where if you make
the<00:20:24.799><c> product</c><00:20:25.039><c> better,</c><00:20:25.440><c> you</c><00:20:25.760><c> kind</c><00:20:25.919><c> of</c><00:20:26.000><c> see</c><00:20:26.080><c> it</c>

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
the product better, you kind of see it
 

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.470 align:start position:0%
the product better, you kind of see it
in<00:20:26.400><c> the</c><00:20:26.480><c> numbers</c><00:20:26.720><c> immediately</c><00:20:27.520><c> where,</c><00:20:28.320><c> you</c>

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the numbers immediately where, you
 

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
in the numbers immediately where, you
know,<00:20:28.640><c> things</c><00:20:28.880><c> start</c><00:20:29.039><c> to</c><00:20:29.200><c> grow</c><00:20:29.360><c> more.</c><00:20:30.080><c> And</c><00:20:30.320><c> so</c>

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
know, things start to grow more. And so
 

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.909 align:start position:0%
know, things start to grow more. And so
we<00:20:30.720><c> felt</c><00:20:30.960><c> it</c><00:20:31.120><c> around,</c><00:20:31.440><c> you</c><00:20:31.520><c> know,</c><00:20:31.600><c> when</c><00:20:31.840><c> we</c>

00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
we felt it around, you know, when we
 

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
we felt it around, you know, when we
first<00:20:32.159><c> started</c><00:20:32.320><c> to</c><00:20:32.480><c> make</c><00:20:32.960><c> cursor</c><00:20:33.360><c> codebase</c>

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
first started to make cursor codebase
 

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.909 align:start position:0%

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.750 align:start position:0%

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.110 align:start position:0%

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
accurate, then when we made that faster,
 

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.669 align:start position:0%

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
then when we made that more ambitious,
 

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.870 align:start position:0%
then when we made that more ambitious,
um,<00:20:43.840><c> you</c><00:20:43.919><c> know,</c><00:20:44.000><c> it</c><00:20:44.159><c> could</c><00:20:44.320><c> predict</c><00:20:44.559><c> sequences</c>

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
um, you know, it could predict sequences
 

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.190 align:start position:0%
um, you know, it could predict sequences
of<00:20:45.039><c> changes,</c><00:20:45.760><c> and</c><00:20:45.919><c> then</c><00:20:46.080><c> when</c><00:20:46.240><c> we</c><00:20:46.400><c> let</c><00:20:46.559><c> the</c><00:20:46.799><c> AI</c>

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
of changes, and then when we let the AI
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.630 align:start position:0%
of changes, and then when we let the AI
model<00:20:47.520><c> start</c><00:20:47.600><c> to</c><00:20:47.760><c> take</c><00:20:47.919><c> more</c><00:20:48.159><c> action</c><00:20:48.400><c> within</c>

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
model start to take more action within
 

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
model start to take more action within
your<00:20:48.799><c> codebase</c><00:20:49.360><c> and</c><00:20:49.600><c> then</c><00:20:49.760><c> do</c><00:20:49.919><c> that</c><00:20:50.159><c> really</c>

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
your codebase and then do that really
 

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
your codebase and then do that really
fast,<00:20:50.880><c> you</c><00:20:50.960><c> know,</c><00:20:51.120><c> speeding</c><00:20:51.440><c> that</c><00:20:51.760><c> up.</c><00:20:52.320><c> And</c><00:20:52.480><c> so</c>

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
fast, you know, speeding that up. And so
 

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
fast, you know, speeding that up. And so
all<00:20:53.120><c> along</c><00:20:53.360><c> the</c><00:20:53.520><c> way,</c><00:20:54.240><c> um,</c><00:20:54.720><c> you</c><00:20:54.880><c> know,</c><00:20:55.039><c> I</c><00:20:55.360><c> we</c>

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
all along the way, um, you know, I we
 

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:56.789 align:start position:0%
all along the way, um, you know, I we
kind<00:20:55.840><c> of</c><00:20:55.919><c> just</c><00:20:56.080><c> focused</c><00:20:56.320><c> on</c><00:20:56.480><c> making</c><00:20:56.640><c> the</c>

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
kind of just focused on making the
 

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
kind of just focused on making the

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
product better. the compounding
continued.<00:20:59.120><c> Um,</c><00:20:59.520><c> and</c><00:21:00.080><c> I</c><00:21:00.320><c> don't</c><00:21:00.400><c> think</c><00:21:00.480><c> that</c>

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
continued. Um, and I don't think that
 

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.909 align:start position:0%
continued. Um, and I don't think that
this<00:21:00.799><c> is</c><00:21:00.880><c> true</c><00:21:01.039><c> of</c><00:21:01.200><c> all</c><00:21:01.360><c> markets,</c><00:21:01.600><c> but</c><00:21:01.760><c> I</c><00:21:01.840><c> think</c>

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
this is true of all markets, but I think
 

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:04.149 align:start position:0%
this is true of all markets, but I think
we're<00:21:02.080><c> we're</c><00:21:02.320><c> in</c><00:21:02.400><c> a</c><00:21:02.799><c> market</c><00:21:03.120><c> where</c><00:21:03.679><c> end</c><00:21:03.840><c> user</c>

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're in a market where end user
 

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
we're we're in a market where end user
preferences<00:21:04.559><c> matter</c><00:21:04.799><c> a</c><00:21:04.960><c> lot.</c><00:21:05.520><c> And</c><00:21:05.760><c> if</c><00:21:05.919><c> you</c>

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
preferences matter a lot. And if you
 

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
preferences matter a lot. And if you
make<00:21:06.159><c> the</c><00:21:06.320><c> best</c><00:21:06.480><c> thing,</c><00:21:06.880><c> people</c><00:21:07.440><c> hear</c><00:21:07.600><c> about</c>

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
make the best thing, people hear about
 

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
make the best thing, people hear about
it<00:21:07.919><c> and</c><00:21:08.240><c> talk</c><00:21:08.480><c> about</c><00:21:08.640><c> it.</c><00:21:08.880><c> And</c><00:21:09.360><c> that</c><00:21:09.600><c> kept</c>

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%

we could go uh pretty far without hiring
anyone.<00:23:56.080><c> We</c><00:23:56.320><c> also</c><00:23:56.559><c> had</c><00:23:56.720><c> our</c><00:23:56.960><c> own,</c><00:23:57.520><c> you</c><00:23:57.600><c> know,</c>

first set of people to hire and how
 

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
first set of people to hire and how

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
exactly to do that. And um so we're both
very<00:24:05.280><c> patient</c><00:24:05.600><c> early</c><00:24:05.840><c> on</c><00:24:06.000><c> and</c><00:24:06.480><c> also,</c><00:24:07.039><c> you</c>
