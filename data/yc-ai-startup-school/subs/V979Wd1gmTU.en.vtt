we were able to really concentrate the

we were able to really concentrate the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.110 align:start position:0%

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
really in the last like 50 years. So we
 

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
really in the last like 50 years. So we
had<00:22:09.679><c> the</c><00:22:10.080><c> you</c><00:22:10.240><c> know</c><00:22:10.480><c> keyboard</c><00:22:10.799><c> and</c><00:22:11.039><c> mouse</c><00:22:11.200><c> and</c>

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity to do a new one
 

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity to do a new one
doesn't<00:22:16.559><c> come</c><00:22:16.720><c> along</c><00:22:16.960><c> that</c><00:22:17.120><c> often</c><00:22:17.760><c> and</c><00:22:18.000><c> I</c>

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't come along that often and I
 

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:21.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't come along that often and I
think<00:22:18.320><c> AI</c><00:22:18.880><c> really</c><00:22:19.200><c> does</c><00:22:20.240><c> totally</c><00:22:20.720><c> open</c><00:22:21.200><c> the</c>

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
think AI really does totally open the
 

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
think AI really does totally open the
playing<00:22:21.760><c> field</c><00:22:21.919><c> for</c><00:22:22.159><c> something</c><00:22:22.320><c> completely</c>

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
playing field for something completely
 

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
playing field for something completely
new<00:22:23.039><c> and</c><00:22:23.360><c> I</c><00:22:23.600><c> think</c><00:22:23.679><c> if</c><00:22:23.840><c> you</c><00:22:23.919><c> got</c><00:22:24.000><c> to</c><00:22:24.159><c> pick</c><00:22:24.320><c> one</c>

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
new and I think if you got to pick one
 

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
new and I think if you got to pick one
person<00:22:24.640><c> to</c><00:22:24.799><c> bet</c><00:22:24.960><c> on</c><00:22:25.039><c> to</c><00:22:25.200><c> figure</c><00:22:25.360><c> that</c><00:22:25.520><c> out</c><00:22:26.000><c> he</c>

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
person to bet on to figure that out he
 

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
person to bet on to figure that out he
is<00:22:26.240><c> the</c><00:22:26.400><c> obvious</c><00:22:26.720><c> bet.</c><00:22:27.200><c> Yeah.</c><00:22:28.159><c> So</c><00:22:28.559><c> one</c><00:22:28.720><c> of</c><00:22:28.799><c> the</c>

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
is the obvious bet. Yeah. So one of the
 

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
is the obvious bet. Yeah. So one of the
things<00:22:29.120><c> that</c><00:22:29.440><c> uh</c><00:22:29.600><c> we've</c><00:22:29.840><c> been</c><00:22:29.919><c> debating</c><00:22:30.240><c> at</c><00:22:30.480><c> YC</c>

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
are two ways you can look at this. Uh
 

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.110 align:start position:0%
are two ways you can look at this. Uh
first<00:23:15.360><c> of</c><00:23:15.440><c> all,</c><00:23:16.000><c> assume</c><00:23:16.240><c> you</c><00:23:16.400><c> all</c><00:23:16.559><c> are</c><00:23:16.720><c> like</c>

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
first of all, assume you all are like
 

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
first of all, assume you all are like
starting<00:23:17.440><c> startups</c><00:23:17.760><c> or</c><00:23:17.919><c> have</c><00:23:18.080><c> started</c>

This<00:23:19.760><c> is</c><00:23:19.840><c> the</c><00:23:20.080><c> best</c><00:23:20.320><c> [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]</c><00:23:20.720><c> time</c><00:23:20.960><c> ever</c><00:23:21.520><c> in</c>

This is the best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time ever in

the history of technology ever, period,
 

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
the history of technology ever, period,

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh<00:23:31.520><c> and</c><00:23:31.840><c> but</c><00:23:32.080><c> part</c><00:23:32.400><c> of</c><00:23:32.480><c> the</c><00:23:32.720><c> reason</c><00:23:32.880><c> it's</c><00:23:33.200><c> the</c>

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh and but part of the reason it's the
 

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.149 align:start position:0%
uh and but part of the reason it's the
best<00:23:34.080><c> is</c><00:23:34.320><c> because</c><00:23:34.880><c> like</c><00:23:35.520><c> the</c><00:23:35.760><c> ground</c><00:23:36.000><c> is</c>

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
best is because like the ground is
 

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:38.310 align:start position:0%
best is because like the ground is

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
shaking and it's true there are a lot of
 

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.230 align:start position:0%
shaking and it's true there are a lot of
these<00:23:38.559><c> challenges.</c><00:23:39.200><c> So</c><00:23:39.440><c> on</c><00:23:39.600><c> one</c><00:23:39.760><c> hand</c><00:23:39.919><c> you</c><00:23:40.159><c> can</c>

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
these challenges. So on one hand you can
 

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.830 align:start position:0%
these challenges. So on one hand you can

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
look at something like that and say we
 

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
look at something like that and say we

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
go away. So you can look at this all of

go away. So you can look at this all of

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
the way I would recommend looking at
 

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.029 align:start position:0%
the way I would recommend looking at

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
them is everybody is going to face the

them is everybody is going to face the

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.149 align:start position:0%

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:07.830 align:start position:0%
change. So I think the the amount that

can we actually build on Earth before we

can we actually build on Earth before we

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
just heat the planet too much from

just heat the planet too much from

00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
running the GPUs and like how long can

running the GPUs and like how long can

really<00:36:33.200><c> thought</c><00:36:33.359><c> of</c><00:36:33.520><c> them</c><00:36:33.680><c> differently.</c><00:36:34.079><c> I</c>

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like one of the uh
 

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like one of the uh
