00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
They kept using it repeatedly. I think
there's<00:09:42.399><c> a</c><00:09:42.640><c> phenomenon</c><00:09:43.040><c> in</c><00:09:43.519><c> products</c><00:09:43.920><c> where</c>

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
used it for an entire month. And so
 

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
used it for an entire month. And so
that's<00:29:14.320><c> good</c><00:29:14.559><c> margins</c><00:29:14.960><c> on</c><00:29:15.120><c> that</c><00:29:15.360><c> user,</c><00:29:15.919><c> right?</c>

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's good margins on that user, right?
 

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.149 align:start position:0%
that's good margins on that user, right?

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
application of foundation models and
 

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
application of foundation models and
then<00:34:52.639><c> they'll</c><00:34:52.960><c> like</c><00:34:53.119><c> build</c><00:34:53.440><c> something</c><00:34:53.679><c> off</c><00:34:53.919><c> of</c>

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
then they'll like build something off of
 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
then they'll like build something off of
that<00:34:54.320><c> but</c><00:34:54.560><c> then</c><00:34:55.280><c> if</c><00:34:55.520><c> it</c><00:34:55.760><c> does</c><00:34:55.919><c> gain</c><00:34:56.240><c> traction</c>

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
that but then if it does gain traction
 

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.270 align:start position:0%
that but then if it does gain traction
then<00:34:57.520><c> the</c><00:34:57.760><c> foundation</c><00:34:58.240><c> models</c><00:34:58.720><c> will</c>

00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
then the foundation models will
 

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
then the foundation models will
consolidate<00:34:59.839><c> that</c><00:35:00.079><c> into</c><00:35:00.320><c> their</c><00:35:00.560><c> own</c>

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.990 align:start position:0%

had<00:35:58.000><c> no</c><00:35:58.240><c> browser</c><00:35:58.560><c> and</c><00:35:58.800><c> they</c><00:35:58.960><c> had</c><00:35:59.119><c> like</c><00:35:59.599><c> maybe</c><00:35:59.920><c> a</c>

100 million queries now you know like
it's<00:36:02.640><c> like</c><00:36:02.960><c> 10</c><00:36:03.200><c> billion</c><00:36:03.520><c> or</c><00:36:03.760><c> something.</c><00:36:04.560><c> So</c>

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's like 10 billion or something. So
 

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
it's like 10 billion or something. So
the<00:36:04.960><c> browser</c><00:36:05.280><c> is</c><00:36:05.440><c> an</c><00:36:05.599><c> important</c><00:36:05.839><c> part</c><00:36:06.000><c> of</c><00:36:06.160><c> that</c>

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
the browser is an important part of that
 

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.069 align:start position:0%
the browser is an important part of that

00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%

tail uh, and there's a massive power

that's the kind of people you're going

00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
strategy to reach them but also remember
 

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:46.710 align:start position:0%
strategy to reach them but also remember
that<00:42:44.800><c> uh</c><00:42:45.200><c> it's</c><00:42:45.520><c> good</c><00:42:45.680><c> to</c><00:42:45.920><c> grow</c><00:42:46.240><c> with</c>

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
that uh it's good to grow with
 

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.790 align:start position:0%
that uh it's good to grow with

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%

some overlapping sets of people who
 

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
some overlapping sets of people who

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be the word of mouth carriers as
 

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.309 align:start position:0%
would be the word of mouth carriers as
they<00:42:53.920><c> help</c><00:42:54.079><c> you</c><00:42:54.240><c> expand</c><00:42:54.640><c> to</c><00:42:54.880><c> more</c><00:42:55.760><c> you</c><00:42:55.920><c> know</c>

00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
they help you expand to more you know
 

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
they help you expand to more you know
non-over<00:42:56.800><c> overlappinging</c><00:42:57.200><c> circles.</c><00:42:57.920><c> So</c><00:42:58.079><c> I</c>

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
non-over overlappinging circles. So I
 

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
non-over overlappinging circles. So I
think<00:42:58.319><c> that</c><00:42:58.480><c> that's</c><00:42:58.640><c> how</c><00:42:58.800><c> I</c><00:42:58.880><c> think</c><00:42:58.960><c> about</c><00:42:59.119><c> it.</c>

00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
think that that's how I think about it.
 

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
think that that's how I think about it.
Like<00:42:59.440><c> there</c><00:42:59.599><c> should</c><00:42:59.680><c> be</c><00:42:59.839><c> some</c><00:43:00.000><c> overlap,</c><00:43:00.480><c> but</c>

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
Like there should be some overlap, but
 

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
Like there should be some overlap, but
your<00:43:02.240><c> distribution</c><00:43:02.800><c> should</c><00:43:03.040><c> keep</c><00:43:03.359><c> evolving</c>

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
your distribution should keep evolving
 

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
your distribution should keep evolving
