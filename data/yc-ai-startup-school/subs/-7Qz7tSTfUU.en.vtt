And uh Evan after about a month or so
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
And uh Evan after about a month or so
said<00:02:15.680><c> hey</c><00:02:16.000><c> like</c><00:02:16.239><c> not</c><00:02:16.400><c> into</c><00:02:16.720><c> drones</c><00:02:17.680><c> uh</c><00:02:18.000><c> for</c><00:02:18.319><c> all</c>

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.229 align:start position:0%
said hey like not into drones uh for all
sorts<00:02:18.720><c> of</c><00:02:18.879><c> various</c><00:02:19.200><c> reasons.</c><00:02:19.920><c> That</c><00:02:20.080><c> was</c><00:02:20.160><c> kind</c>

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
sorts of various reasons. That was kind
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
sorts of various reasons. That was kind
of<00:02:20.319><c> the</c><00:02:20.400><c> one</c><00:02:20.560><c> I</c><00:02:20.720><c> was</c><00:02:20.800><c> pushing</c><00:02:20.959><c> for</c><00:02:21.200><c> more</c><00:02:21.360><c> at</c><00:02:21.520><c> the</c>

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the one I was pushing for more at the
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0%
of the one I was pushing for more at the
time<00:02:22.239><c> also</c><00:02:22.560><c> except</c><00:02:22.800><c> WebGL</c><00:02:23.280><c> of</c><00:02:23.440><c> course.</c><00:02:23.760><c> And</c>

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
time also except WebGL of course. And
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.350 align:start position:0%
time also except WebGL of course. And
then<00:02:24.800><c> uh</c><00:02:25.120><c> I</c><00:02:25.280><c> was</c><00:02:25.360><c> like</c><00:02:25.599><c> great</c><00:02:25.840><c> WebGL</c><00:02:26.319><c> it</c><00:02:26.480><c> is.</c>

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
then uh I was like great WebGL it is.
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
then uh I was like great WebGL it is.
And<00:02:27.599><c> so</c><00:02:28.239><c> WebGL</c><00:02:28.959><c> I</c><00:02:29.200><c> think</c><00:02:29.280><c> everybody</c><00:02:29.680><c> probably</c>

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
And so WebGL I think everybody probably
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.070 align:start position:0%
And so WebGL I think everybody probably
here<00:02:30.239><c> knows</c><00:02:30.640><c> but</c><00:02:31.120><c> is</c><00:02:31.280><c> a</c><00:02:31.360><c> way</c><00:02:31.520><c> to</c><00:02:31.599><c> use</c><00:02:31.680><c> the</c><00:02:31.840><c> GPU</c>

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
here knows but is a way to use the GPU
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.070 align:start position:0%
here knows but is a way to use the GPU
in<00:02:32.239><c> your</c><00:02:32.319><c> computer</c><00:02:32.640><c> and</c><00:02:32.720><c> the</c><00:02:32.800><c> browser.</c><00:02:33.599><c> Uh</c><00:02:33.840><c> web</c>

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
GPU is its successor. And yeah, we uh
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.509 align:start position:0%
GPU is its successor. And yeah, we uh
started<00:02:38.000><c> going</c><00:02:38.160><c> really</c><00:02:38.480><c> deep</c><00:02:38.800><c> on</c><00:02:39.040><c> like</c><00:02:39.360><c> what</c>

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
started going really deep on like what
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.309 align:start position:0%
started going really deep on like what
are<00:02:39.680><c> all</c><00:02:39.760><c> the</c><00:02:39.920><c> things</c><00:02:40.080><c> that</c><00:02:40.319><c> we</c><00:02:40.480><c> can</c><00:02:40.720><c> build</c><00:02:41.680><c> and</c>

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
are all the things that we can build and
 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.869 align:start position:0%
are all the things that we can build and
two<00:02:42.640><c> main</c><00:02:42.879><c> paths</c><00:02:43.280><c> were</c><00:02:43.440><c> games</c><00:02:43.760><c> or</c><00:02:44.000><c> tools</c>

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
two main paths were games or tools
 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.550 align:start position:0%

pretty<00:02:45.280><c> fast.</c><00:02:45.519><c> We</c><00:02:45.680><c> said</c><00:02:45.840><c> okay</c><00:02:46.080><c> not</c><00:02:46.319><c> games</c>

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%

let's<00:02:46.800><c> go</c><00:02:46.959><c> tools</c><00:02:47.840><c> and</c><00:02:48.000><c> then</c><00:02:48.160><c> it</c><00:02:48.400><c> was</c><00:02:49.040><c> a</c><00:02:49.360><c> deep</c>

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
risk to the scenario. And also it helped
 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
risk to the scenario. And also it helped
that<00:04:11.760><c> I</c><00:04:11.840><c> had</c><00:04:11.920><c> the</c><00:04:12.000><c> Teal</c><00:04:12.239><c> Fellowship.</c><00:04:13.200><c> Uh,</c><00:04:13.760><c> I</c>

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
that I had the Teal Fellowship. Uh, I
 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.750 align:start position:0%
that I had the Teal Fellowship. Uh, I
would<00:04:14.080><c> have</c><00:04:14.159><c> done</c><00:04:14.239><c> it</c><00:04:14.400><c> without</c><00:04:14.560><c> it,</c><00:04:14.720><c> but</c><00:04:15.040><c> like</c>

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
would have done it without it, but like
 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.310 align:start position:0%
would have done it without it, but like
having<00:04:16.079><c> 100K</c><00:04:16.560><c> over</c><00:04:16.720><c> two</c><00:04:16.959><c> years,</c><00:04:17.280><c> I</c><00:04:17.440><c> know</c><00:04:17.600><c> now,</c>

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
you know, inflation, etc. probably
sounds<00:04:20.400><c> like</c><00:04:20.560><c> less</c><00:04:20.799><c> than</c><00:04:20.880><c> it</c><00:04:21.040><c> was</c><00:04:21.440><c> then,</c><00:04:22.240><c> but</c>

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like less than it was then, but
 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
sounds like less than it was then, but
yeah,<00:04:23.120><c> I</c><00:04:23.360><c> mean</c><00:04:23.440><c> to</c><00:04:23.759><c> have</c><00:04:24.240><c> actual</c><00:04:24.720><c> cash</c><00:04:25.040><c> and</c><00:04:25.280><c> not</c>

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah, I mean to have actual cash and not
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
yeah, I mean to have actual cash and not

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
cash element, but also because it gives
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.469 align:start position:0%

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
you time. Uh, if we had stopped six
months<00:04:34.720><c> in</c><00:04:35.360><c> and</c><00:04:35.600><c> that</c><00:04:35.759><c> was</c><00:04:35.840><c> our</c><00:04:36.080><c> point</c><00:04:36.240><c> where</c>

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
months in and that was our point where
 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
months in and that was our point where
we<00:04:36.639><c> made</c><00:04:36.720><c> a</c><00:04:36.960><c> call,</c><00:04:37.520><c> Figma</c><00:04:38.000><c> would</c><00:04:38.160><c> not</c><00:04:38.240><c> be</c><00:04:38.400><c> here</c>

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
we made a call, Figma would not be here
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.710 align:start position:0%
we made a call, Figma would not be here
today.<00:04:39.280><c> And</c><00:04:39.520><c> so</c><00:04:39.680><c> I</c><00:04:39.919><c> think</c><00:04:40.000><c> if</c><00:04:40.160><c> you're</c><00:04:40.479><c> a</c>

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
today. And so I think if you're a
 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.790 align:start position:0%
today. And so I think if you're a
founder<00:04:41.199><c> already</c><00:04:41.520><c> going</c><00:04:41.759><c> or</c><00:04:42.080><c> you're</c><00:04:42.560><c> thinking</c>

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
founder already going or you're thinking
 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
founder already going or you're thinking
about<00:04:43.040><c> founding,</c><00:04:44.000><c> you</c><00:04:44.160><c> got</c><00:04:44.240><c> to</c><00:04:44.400><c> give</c><00:04:44.560><c> yourself</c>

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
about founding, you got to give yourself
 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
about founding, you got to give yourself
time<00:04:45.120><c> somehow.</c><00:04:45.600><c> That's</c><00:04:45.840><c> really</c><00:04:46.080><c> important.</c>

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
time somehow. That's really important.
 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.070 align:start position:0%
time somehow. That's really important.
Yeah.<00:04:46.720><c> You</c><00:04:46.960><c> spent</c><00:04:47.120><c> a</c><00:04:47.280><c> couple</c><00:04:47.440><c> years</c><00:04:47.840><c> trying</c>

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
Yeah. You spent a couple years trying
 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.590 align:start position:0%
Yeah. You spent a couple years trying
to,<00:04:48.560><c> you</c><00:04:48.639><c> know,</c><00:04:48.800><c> do</c><00:04:48.960><c> all</c><00:04:49.120><c> the</c><00:04:49.199><c> twists</c><00:04:49.440><c> and</c>

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
to, you know, do all the twists and
 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.790 align:start position:0%
to, you know, do all the twists and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
turns and the thing that eventually
 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.189 align:start position:0%
turns and the thing that eventually
became<00:04:51.120><c> what</c><00:04:51.280><c> Figma</c><00:04:52.160><c> um</c><00:04:52.320><c> is</c><00:04:52.560><c> today.</c>

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
became what Figma um is today.
 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:53.749 align:start position:0%
became what Figma um is today.
Yeah.

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%

Brown for this? That was probably like a

Brown for this? That was probably like a

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
pretty low point at the start. But other

pretty low point at the start. But other

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%

you're not just alone, you know,
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
you're not just alone, you know,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
your lows, their highs cancel out
 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.710 align:start position:0%
your lows, their highs cancel out
somehow<00:06:07.120><c> and</c><00:06:07.840><c> you</c><00:06:08.080><c> can</c><00:06:08.160><c> kind</c><00:06:08.240><c> of</c><00:06:08.319><c> feed</c><00:06:08.560><c> off</c>

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
somehow and you can kind of feed off

somehow and you can kind of feed off
each<00:06:08.880><c> other</c><00:06:08.960><c> to</c><00:06:09.120><c> keep</c><00:06:09.280><c> each</c><00:06:09.360><c> other</c><00:06:09.520><c> going.</c>

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
essential and uh you should launch as
 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
essential and uh you should launch as
quickly<00:09:07.519><c> as</c><00:09:07.680><c> you</c><00:09:07.839><c> can.</c><00:09:08.000><c> For</c><00:09:08.240><c> me,</c><00:09:08.800><c> the</c><00:09:09.120><c> feedback</c>

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
quickly as you can. For me, the feedback
 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
quickly as you can. For me, the feedback
was<00:09:09.600><c> very</c><00:09:09.920><c> clear.</c><00:09:10.399><c> It's</c><00:09:10.720><c> not</c><00:09:10.880><c> ready</c><00:09:12.080><c> and</c><00:09:13.040><c> that</c>

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
was very clear. It's not ready and that
 

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
was very clear. It's not ready and that
made<00:09:13.519><c> it</c><00:09:13.680><c> so</c><00:09:14.000><c> we</c><00:09:14.160><c> didn't</c><00:09:14.320><c> feel</c><00:09:14.480><c> comfortable</c>

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
made it so we didn't feel comfortable
 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.190 align:start position:0%
made it so we didn't feel comfortable
launching<00:09:15.120><c> yet.</c><00:09:16.080><c> But</c><00:09:16.399><c> looking</c><00:09:16.720><c> back,</c><00:09:16.880><c> we</c><00:09:17.120><c> did</c>

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
launching yet. But looking back, we did
 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.790 align:start position:0%
launching yet. But looking back, we did
have<00:09:17.279><c> the</c><00:09:17.440><c> capital.</c><00:09:17.839><c> I</c><00:09:18.000><c> should</c><00:09:18.160><c> have</c><00:09:18.480><c> scaled</c>

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the capital. I should have scaled
 

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.190 align:start position:0%
have the capital. I should have scaled
the<00:09:18.959><c> team</c><00:09:19.120><c> faster</c><00:09:19.839><c> so</c><00:09:20.000><c> we</c><00:09:20.160><c> could</c><00:09:20.320><c> move</c><00:09:20.560><c> faster</c>

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
the team faster so we could move faster
 

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
the team faster so we could move faster
and<00:09:21.440><c> get</c><00:09:21.600><c> it</c><00:09:21.760><c> out</c><00:09:21.920><c> quicker.</c><00:09:22.800><c> That</c><00:09:23.040><c> was</c>

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
and get it out quicker. That was
 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
and get it out quicker. That was
something<00:09:23.440><c> that</c><00:09:23.600><c> I</c><00:09:23.920><c> now</c><00:09:24.240><c> looking</c><00:09:24.560><c> back</c><00:09:24.880><c> have</c>

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
something that I now looking back have
 

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
something that I now looking back have
learned.<00:09:26.000><c> And</c><00:09:26.640><c> when</c><00:09:26.880><c> a</c><00:09:27.120><c> team</c><00:09:27.200><c> at</c><00:09:27.360><c> Figma</c><00:09:27.839><c> comes</c>

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
learned. And when a team at Figma comes
 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.310 align:start position:0%
learned. And when a team at Figma comes
to<00:09:28.080><c> me</c><00:09:28.240><c> with</c><00:09:28.399><c> a</c><00:09:28.880><c> epic</c><00:09:29.360><c> road</c><00:09:29.600><c> map</c><00:09:29.920><c> that</c><00:09:30.160><c> they</c>

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
to me with a epic road map that they
 

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
to me with a epic road map that they
think<00:09:30.480><c> is</c><00:09:30.720><c> perfection,</c><00:09:31.760><c> the</c><00:09:32.000><c> first</c><00:09:32.240><c> question</c>

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
think is perfection, the first question
 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
think is perfection, the first question
I<00:09:32.720><c> always</c><00:09:32.959><c> ask</c><00:09:33.120><c> is</c><00:09:33.440><c> how</c><00:09:33.519><c> do</c><00:09:33.600><c> we</c><00:09:33.760><c> slim</c><00:09:34.000><c> slim</c><00:09:34.240><c> that</c>

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
I always ask is how do we slim slim that
 

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.870 align:start position:0%
I always ask is how do we slim slim that
down?<00:09:35.200><c> How</c><00:09:35.360><c> do</c><00:09:35.440><c> we</c><00:09:35.600><c> make</c><00:09:35.680><c> it</c><00:09:35.839><c> more</c><00:09:36.000><c> bite-sized</c>

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
down? How do we make it more bite-sized
 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
down? How do we make it more bite-sized
and<00:09:37.200><c> test</c><00:09:37.440><c> this</c><00:09:37.680><c> earlier</c><00:09:38.000><c> with</c><00:09:38.240><c> our</c><00:09:38.399><c> users?</c>

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
and test this earlier with our users?
 

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.670 align:start position:0%
and test this earlier with our users?
So,<00:09:40.080><c> it's</c><00:09:40.320><c> it's</c><00:09:40.720><c> absolutely</c><00:09:41.040><c> the</c><00:09:41.200><c> case</c><00:09:41.279><c> that</c><00:09:41.519><c> I</c>

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
So, it's it's absolutely the case that I
 

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
So, it's it's absolutely the case that I
try<00:09:41.839><c> to</c><00:09:42.000><c> push</c><00:09:42.240><c> people</c><00:09:43.040><c> internally</c><00:09:43.600><c> towards,</c>

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
try to push people internally towards,
 

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
try to push people internally towards,
you<00:09:44.560><c> know,</c><00:09:44.720><c> a</c><00:09:44.959><c> one</c><00:09:45.200><c> month</c><00:09:45.360><c> or</c><00:09:45.600><c> three</c><00:09:45.760><c> month</c>

people are like, well, I have all this

people are like, well, I have all this

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
stuff I have to build, so I need to go
 

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
stuff I have to build, so I need to go
hire<00:10:01.519><c> a</c><00:10:01.760><c> bunch</c><00:10:01.839><c> of</c><00:10:02.000><c> people</c><00:10:02.160><c> to</c><00:10:02.399><c> be</c><00:10:02.480><c> able</c><00:10:02.640><c> to</c><00:10:02.800><c> do</c>

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
hire a bunch of people to be able to do
 

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
hire a bunch of people to be able to do
it.<00:10:03.440><c> But</c><00:10:03.600><c> it</c><00:10:03.760><c> seems</c><00:10:03.920><c> like</c><00:10:04.080><c> usually</c><00:10:04.399><c> the</c><00:10:04.560><c> right</c>

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
it. But it seems like usually the right
 

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
it. But it seems like usually the right
answer<00:10:04.880><c> is</c><00:10:05.120><c> like,</c><00:10:05.279><c> how</c><00:10:05.440><c> can</c><00:10:05.600><c> you</c><00:10:05.680><c> scope</c><00:10:06.000><c> it</c>

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
answer is like, how can you scope it
 

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
answer is like, how can you scope it
down<00:10:06.240><c> and</c><00:10:06.399><c> do</c><00:10:06.560><c> fewer</c><00:10:06.880><c> things</c><00:10:07.200><c> really</c><00:10:07.519><c> well?</c>

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
down and do fewer things really well?
 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
down and do fewer things really well?
Like<00:10:07.920><c> it</c><00:10:08.080><c> sounds</c><00:10:08.240><c> like</c><00:10:08.399><c> is</c><00:10:08.640><c> that</c><00:10:08.720><c> part</c><00:10:08.880><c> of</c><00:10:08.959><c> your</c>

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
Like it sounds like is that part of your
 

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
Like it sounds like is that part of your
culture<00:10:09.440><c> as</c><00:10:09.680><c> you're</c><00:10:09.839><c> building</c><00:10:10.080><c> things?</c><00:10:10.480><c> Yeah,</c>

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
culture as you're building things? Yeah,
 

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
culture as you're building things? Yeah,
it's<00:10:11.200><c> constraints</c><00:10:11.680><c> can</c><00:10:11.839><c> actually</c><00:10:12.080><c> really</c>

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's constraints can actually really
 

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.829 align:start position:0%
it's constraints can actually really
help.<00:10:12.720><c> But</c><00:10:12.800><c> I</c><00:10:12.959><c> also</c><00:10:13.200><c> think</c><00:10:13.279><c> the</c><00:10:13.440><c> startup</c>

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
help. But I also think the startup
 

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.509 align:start position:0%
help. But I also think the startup
equation

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
equation
 

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.430 align:start position:0%

or<00:10:15.760><c> not</c><00:10:15.920><c> equation,</c><00:10:16.320><c> but</c><00:10:16.720><c> the</c><00:10:16.959><c> cycle</c><00:10:17.200><c> that</c>

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
with the process of it. So yeah, I think
 

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.829 align:start position:0%
with the process of it. So yeah, I think
for<00:13:22.639><c> me</c><00:13:22.800><c> it's</c><00:13:23.120><c> just</c><00:13:23.279><c> maybe</c><00:13:23.440><c> a</c><00:13:23.680><c> different</c>

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
for me it's just maybe a different
 

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
for me it's just maybe a different

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
it out there. So, how do we get that so
 

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
it out there. So, how do we get that so
that<00:18:30.799><c> they</c><00:18:30.960><c> can</c><00:18:31.039><c> actually</c><00:18:31.280><c> ship</c><00:18:31.520><c> it?</c><00:18:32.000><c> And</c><00:18:32.160><c> then</c>

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
that they can actually ship it? And then
 

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
that they can actually ship it? And then
make,<00:18:33.280><c> uh,</c><00:18:33.679><c> we're</c><00:18:33.919><c> so</c><00:18:34.160><c> excited</c><00:18:34.320><c> about</c><00:18:34.559><c> make.</c>

about that with the tools that you're

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
how that process has changed like how
 

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
how that process has changed like how

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
your own development process has changed
 

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
your own development process has changed
within<00:19:18.000><c> Figma?</c>

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
within Figma?
 

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.230 align:start position:0%
within Figma?
I'll<00:19:18.799><c> start</c><00:19:18.960><c> with</c><00:19:19.120><c> Figma.</c><00:19:19.760><c> Uh,</c><00:19:20.480><c> I</c><00:19:20.799><c> think</c><00:19:20.880><c> that</c>

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
I'll start with Figma. Uh, I think that
 

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
I'll start with Figma. Uh, I think that
for<00:19:22.480><c> us</c><00:19:22.880><c> it's</c><00:19:23.120><c> all</c><00:19:23.280><c> about</c><00:19:23.440><c> speed</c><00:19:23.679><c> of</c>

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
for us it's all about speed of
 

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
for us it's all about speed of
iteration,<00:19:24.320><c> speed</c><00:19:24.559><c> of</c><00:19:24.720><c> testing</c><00:19:25.039><c> ideas</c><00:19:26.000><c> and</c>

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
iteration, speed of testing ideas and
 

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
iteration, speed of testing ideas and
tools<00:19:26.640><c> like</c><00:19:26.799><c> make</c><00:19:27.120><c> really</c><00:19:27.360><c> help</c><00:19:27.520><c> with</c><00:19:27.679><c> that.</c>

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
tools like make really help with that.
 

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.549 align:start position:0%
tools like make really help with that.
It<00:19:28.720><c> helps</c><00:19:28.880><c> to</c><00:19:29.120><c> have</c><00:19:29.600><c> ways</c><00:19:29.840><c> to</c><00:19:30.080><c> rapidly</c>

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
It helps to have ways to rapidly
 

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
It helps to have ways to rapidly
prototype<00:19:31.600><c> and</c><00:19:31.919><c> to</c><00:19:32.799><c> figure</c><00:19:33.039><c> out</c><00:19:33.280><c> what's</c><00:19:33.520><c> going</c>

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
to work and what's not going to work and
 

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.789 align:start position:0%
to work and what's not going to work and
make<00:19:34.799><c> that</c><00:19:34.960><c> as</c><00:19:35.120><c> low</c><00:19:35.600><c> cost</c><00:19:35.679><c> cost</c><00:19:35.840><c> as</c><00:19:36.080><c> possible.</c>

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
make that as low cost cost as possible.
 

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:38.230 align:start position:0%
make that as low cost cost as possible.
And<00:19:36.960><c> then</c><00:19:37.120><c> there's</c><00:19:37.360><c> tools</c><00:19:37.600><c> I</c><00:19:37.840><c> can't</c><00:19:38.000><c> talk</c>

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
And then there's tools I can't talk
 

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
And then there's tools I can't talk

about and things we're developing that
 

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
about and things we're developing that
uh<00:19:41.360><c> have</c><00:19:41.679><c> been</c><00:19:41.840><c> pretty</c><00:19:42.080><c> instrumental</c><00:19:42.640><c> to</c><00:19:43.039><c> how</c>

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh have been pretty instrumental to how
 

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.669 align:start position:0%
uh have been pretty instrumental to how
our<00:19:43.520><c> development</c><00:19:43.840><c> process</c><00:19:44.080><c> is</c><00:19:44.320><c> changing.</c><00:19:45.120><c> Um,</c>

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
our development process is changing. Um,
 

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
our development process is changing. Um,
so<00:19:45.919><c> yeah,</c><00:19:46.240><c> can't</c><00:19:46.480><c> wait</c><00:19:46.640><c> to</c><00:19:46.720><c> talk</c><00:19:46.880><c> about</c><00:19:47.120><c> you</c>

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah, can't wait to talk about you
 

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
so yeah, can't wait to talk about you
with<00:19:47.440><c> them,</c><00:19:47.520><c> but</c><00:19:47.760><c> not</c><00:19:47.919><c> today</c><00:19:48.240><c> sadly.</c><00:19:48.799><c> Yeah,</c>

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
with them, but not today sadly. Yeah,
 

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.350 align:start position:0%
with them, but not today sadly. Yeah,
when<00:19:49.280><c> you</c><00:19:49.360><c> go</c><00:19:49.520><c> back</c><00:19:49.679><c> to</c><00:19:50.720><c> just</c><00:19:50.880><c> the</c><00:19:51.039><c> way</c><00:19:51.200><c> that</c>

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
when you go back to just the way that
 

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
when you go back to just the way that
design<00:19:51.600><c> and</c><00:19:51.840><c> development</c><00:19:52.240><c> are</c><00:19:52.400><c> blurring</c>

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
design and development are blurring
 

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.789 align:start position:0%
design and development are blurring
more,<00:19:53.840><c> um</c><00:19:54.960><c> I</c><00:19:55.200><c> think</c><00:19:55.280><c> it</c><00:19:56.160><c> there's</c><00:19:56.480><c> a</c><00:19:56.640><c> lot</c><00:19:56.720><c> of</c>

00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
more, um I think it there's a lot of
 

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
more, um I think it there's a lot of
stuff<00:19:56.960><c> going</c><00:19:57.120><c> on</c><00:19:57.280><c> there.</c><00:19:57.440><c> I</c><00:19:57.600><c> think</c><00:19:57.679><c> product</c><00:19:57.919><c> is</c>

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
stuff going on there. I think product is
 

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
stuff going on there. I think product is
also<00:19:58.400><c> blurring</c><00:19:59.120><c> with</c><00:19:59.360><c> design</c><00:19:59.600><c> and</c>

00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
also blurring with design and
 

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.669 align:start position:0%
also blurring with design and
development<00:20:00.400><c> and</c><00:20:00.720><c> potentially</c><00:20:01.120><c> even</c><00:20:01.360><c> parts</c>

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
development and potentially even parts
 

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
development and potentially even parts
of<00:20:01.840><c> research.</c><00:20:02.799><c> All</c><00:20:03.039><c> this</c><00:20:03.200><c> is</c><00:20:03.440><c> becoming</c><00:20:03.760><c> less</c>

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
of research. All this is becoming less
 

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
of research. All this is becoming less
distinct<00:20:05.120><c> and</c><00:20:05.919><c> uh</c><00:20:06.559><c> it's</c><00:20:06.880><c> all</c><00:20:07.039><c> kind</c><00:20:07.120><c> of</c><00:20:07.280><c> coming</c>

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%

together<00:20:07.760><c> more.</c><00:20:08.320><c> I</c><00:20:08.480><c> think</c><00:20:08.559><c> this</c><00:20:08.799><c> is</c><00:20:08.960><c> happening</c>

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
together more. I think this is happening
 

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.630 align:start position:0%
together more. I think this is happening
before<00:20:09.440><c> AI,</c><00:20:09.760><c> but</c><00:20:09.919><c> it's</c><00:20:10.080><c> happening</c><00:20:10.320><c> even</c><00:20:10.480><c> more</c>

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
before AI, but it's happening even more
 

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.029 align:start position:0%
before AI, but it's happening even more
with<00:20:10.880><c> AI.</c><00:20:11.679><c> There's</c><00:20:11.919><c> something</c><00:20:12.080><c> about</c><00:20:12.320><c> AI</c><00:20:12.720><c> that</c>

00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
with AI. There's something about AI that
 

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
with AI. There's something about AI that
empowers<00:20:13.679><c> generalist</c><00:20:14.240><c> behavior.</c><00:20:14.799><c> I</c><00:20:15.039><c> will</c><00:20:15.200><c> say</c>

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
empowers generalist behavior. I will say
 

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
empowers generalist behavior. I will say
that<00:20:15.600><c> I</c><00:20:15.760><c> think</c><00:20:15.840><c> that</c><00:20:16.880><c> the</c><00:20:17.120><c> models</c><00:20:17.520><c> today</c><00:20:17.760><c> are</c>

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that the models today are
 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.750 align:start position:0%
that I think that the models today are
better<00:20:18.240><c> at</c>

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
better at
 

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.990 align:start position:0%
better at
the<00:20:20.160><c> earlier</c><00:20:20.559><c> phases</c><00:20:20.880><c> of</c><00:20:21.120><c> development</c><00:20:21.760><c> than</c>

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the earlier phases of development than
 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.350 align:start position:0%
the earlier phases of development than
they<00:20:22.160><c> are</c><00:20:22.320><c> at</c><00:20:22.640><c> like</c><00:20:23.280><c> late</c><00:20:23.600><c> stage</c><00:20:24.080><c> code</c><00:20:24.400><c> bases.</c>

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
they are at like late stage code bases.
 

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.029 align:start position:0%
they are at like late stage code bases.
Um,<00:20:25.919><c> so</c><00:20:26.080><c> if</c><00:20:26.240><c> you</c><00:20:26.320><c> have</c><00:20:26.400><c> an</c><00:20:26.559><c> established</c>

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
Um, so if you have an established
 

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.470 align:start position:0%
Um, so if you have an established
codebase,<00:20:27.760><c> I</c><00:20:27.919><c> think</c><00:20:28.000><c> you're</c><00:20:28.159><c> going</c><00:20:28.240><c> to</c><00:20:28.320><c> get</c>

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
codebase, I think you're going to get
 

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.029 align:start position:0%
codebase, I think you're going to get
less<00:20:28.720><c> out</c><00:20:28.880><c> of</c><00:20:29.600><c> uh</c><00:20:29.760><c> AI</c><00:20:30.159><c> development</c><00:20:30.559><c> tools</c><00:20:30.799><c> as</c>

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
less out of uh AI development tools as
 

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
less out of uh AI development tools as
they<00:20:31.200><c> currently</c><00:20:31.520><c> exist</c><00:20:32.080><c> than</c><00:20:32.240><c> if</c><00:20:32.400><c> you're</c><00:20:32.559><c> at</c>

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
they currently exist than if you're at
 

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
they currently exist than if you're at
the<00:20:32.799><c> very</c><00:20:33.039><c> start.</c><00:20:33.600><c> So</c><00:20:33.760><c> I</c><00:20:33.919><c> think</c><00:20:34.080><c> that</c>

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
the very start. So I think that
 

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
the very start. So I think that
everything's<00:20:34.799><c> better</c><00:20:35.039><c> suited</c><00:20:35.360><c> for</c>

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
everything's better suited for
 

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.470 align:start position:0%
everything's better suited for
prototyping<00:20:36.640><c> and</c><00:20:37.039><c> sort</c><00:20:37.200><c> of</c><00:20:37.360><c> like</c><00:20:37.520><c> zero</c><00:20:37.760><c> to</c><00:20:38.000><c> one</c>

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
prototyping and sort of like zero to one
 

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.029 align:start position:0%
prototyping and sort of like zero to one
than<00:20:38.720><c> it</c><00:20:38.799><c> is</c><00:20:38.960><c> from</c><00:20:39.120><c> one</c><00:20:39.280><c> to</c><00:20:39.440><c> 100</c><00:20:40.480><c> uh</c><00:20:40.640><c> at</c><00:20:40.880><c> this</c>

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
than it is from one to 100 uh at this
 

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
than it is from one to 100 uh at this
current<00:20:41.280><c> moment.</c><00:20:41.679><c> But</c><00:20:41.840><c> you</c><00:20:42.000><c> know,</c><00:20:42.080><c> in</c><00:20:42.320><c> a</c><00:20:42.559><c> week</c>

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
current moment. But you know, in a week
 

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
current moment. But you know, in a week
this<00:20:43.360><c> could</c><00:20:43.600><c> change.</c><00:20:44.000><c> Yeah,</c><00:20:44.320><c> it</c><00:20:44.559><c> changes</c><00:20:44.799><c> so</c>

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
this could change. Yeah, it changes so
 

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:45.350 align:start position:0%
this could change. Yeah, it changes so
fast.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
fast.
 

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.990 align:start position:0%
fast.
Yes.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
Yes.
 

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
Yes.
Um<00:20:47.120><c> I</c><00:20:47.360><c> mean</c><00:20:47.520><c> related</c><00:20:47.760><c> to</c><00:20:47.840><c> that,</c><00:20:48.080><c> how</c><00:20:48.159><c> do</c><00:20:48.320><c> you</c>

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
Um I mean related to that, how do you
 

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
Um I mean related to that, how do you
expect<00:20:48.559><c> user</c><00:20:48.880><c> interfaces</c><00:20:49.440><c> to</c><00:20:49.679><c> change</c><00:20:50.240><c> uh</c><00:20:50.400><c> over</c>

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
expect user interfaces to change uh over

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
the next couple years? And feels like
 

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.390 align:start position:0%
the next couple years? And feels like

dominant uh interface paradigm, but I
don't<00:20:57.200><c> know,</c><00:20:57.360><c> it</c><00:20:57.440><c> feels</c><00:20:57.600><c> like</c><00:20:57.760><c> there's</c><00:20:58.000><c> got</c><00:20:58.080><c> to</c>

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't know, it feels like there's got to
 

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
don't know, it feels like there's got to
be<00:20:58.320><c> something</c><00:20:58.559><c> better</c><00:20:58.880><c> that</c><00:20:59.120><c> comes</c><00:20:59.360><c> along,</c>

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
be something better that comes along,
 

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.549 align:start position:0%

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
to do with these models is a very hard

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.029 align:start position:0%
private. But the flip side of that is
you<00:21:53.120><c> actually</c><00:21:53.280><c> learn</c><00:21:53.520><c> what</c><00:21:53.679><c> you</c><00:21:53.840><c> can</c><00:21:54.000><c> do</c><00:21:54.799><c> and</c>

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
you actually learn what you can do and
 

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
you actually learn what you can do and
so<00:21:55.600><c> I</c><00:21:55.760><c> think</c><00:21:55.840><c> that's</c><00:21:56.080><c> been</c><00:21:56.240><c> underexplored</c><00:21:57.200><c> uh</c>

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that's been underexplored uh
 

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
so I think that's been underexplored uh
in<00:21:57.440><c> the</c><00:21:57.600><c> media.</c><00:21:58.080><c> So</c><00:21:58.320><c> I</c><00:21:58.559><c> I</c><00:21:58.559><c> I</c><00:21:58.960><c> think</c><00:21:59.039><c> that</c>

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
in the media. So I I I think that
there's<00:21:59.440><c> this</c><00:21:59.760><c> problem</c><00:22:00.080><c> that</c><00:22:00.400><c> people</c><00:22:00.720><c> have</c>

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
create a system around it. But I think

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%

the research side point uh it's been
 

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.990 align:start position:0%
the research side point uh it's been

uh, as you design these models, I think

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's probably true. But I guess I'd
 

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0%
that's probably true. But I guess I'd

with critical thought uh and learn

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
something, the next question is okay,
how<00:32:15.360><c> to</c><00:32:15.440><c> make</c><00:32:15.519><c> it</c><00:32:15.679><c> good?</c><00:32:16.640><c> And</c><00:32:17.519><c> you</c><00:32:17.679><c> know,</c>

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
how to make it good? And you know,
 

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
how to make it good? And you know,
there's<00:32:18.080><c> different</c><00:32:18.320><c> ways</c><00:32:18.480><c> to</c><00:32:18.640><c> do</c><00:32:18.720><c> that.</c><00:32:19.039><c> Uh</c>

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's different ways to do that. Uh
 

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.830 align:start position:0%
there's different ways to do that. Uh
you<00:32:19.519><c> can</c><00:32:19.679><c> be</c><00:32:19.919><c> writing</c><00:32:20.240><c> code</c><00:32:20.880><c> and</c><00:32:21.279><c> going</c><00:32:21.519><c> into</c>

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
you can be writing code and going into
 

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
you can be writing code and going into
your<00:32:22.320><c> browser</c><00:32:22.799><c> and</c><00:32:23.440><c> kind</c><00:32:23.679><c> of</c><00:32:23.760><c> having</c><00:32:24.000><c> that</c>

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.230 align:start position:0%

we're trying to enable that uh in a way
 

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.110 align:start position:0%
we're trying to enable that uh in a way
that's<00:32:33.679><c> visual</c><00:32:34.000><c> first</c><00:32:34.399><c> rather</c><00:32:34.640><c> than</c><00:32:34.799><c> code</c>

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's visual first rather than code
 

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
that's visual first rather than code

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.909 align:start position:0%
server to explicitly make it so that you

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
can get your designs into cursor and
 

00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
can get your designs into cursor and
windsurf<00:32:48.480><c> and</c><00:32:48.559><c> all</c><00:32:48.720><c> these</c><00:32:48.880><c> other</c><00:32:49.039><c> NVS</c><00:32:49.600><c> code</c>

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
windsurf and all these other NVS code
 

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
windsurf and all these other NVS code
you<00:32:50.080><c> know</c><00:32:50.240><c> all</c><00:32:50.320><c> these</c><00:32:50.480><c> great</c><00:32:50.640><c> tools</c><00:32:51.039><c> faster.</c>

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know all these great tools faster.
 

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.350 align:start position:0%
you know all these great tools faster.
So<00:32:52.240><c> I</c><00:32:52.480><c> think</c><00:32:52.559><c> there's</c><00:32:52.799><c> just</c><00:32:52.960><c> going</c><00:32:52.960><c> to</c><00:32:53.039><c> be</c><00:32:53.200><c> new</c>

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
So I think there's just going to be new
 

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
So I think there's just going to be new
workflows<00:32:53.760><c> that</c><00:32:53.919><c> are</c><00:32:54.080><c> established</c><00:32:55.120><c> and</c><00:32:55.919><c> like</c>

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
workflows that are established and like
 

00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:58.470 align:start position:0%
workflows that are established and like
I<00:32:56.320><c> said</c><00:32:56.640><c> if</c><00:32:56.799><c> the</c><00:32:56.960><c> differentiator</c><00:32:57.360><c> is</c><00:32:57.600><c> design</c>

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
I said if the differentiator is design
 

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
I said if the differentiator is design
then<00:32:59.120><c> your</c><00:32:59.440><c> first</c><00:32:59.600><c> generation</c><00:33:00.159><c> your</c><00:33:00.320><c> oneshot</c>

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
then your first generation your oneshot
 

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
then your first generation your oneshot
is<00:33:01.360><c> probably</c><00:33:01.600><c> not</c><00:33:01.760><c> the</c><00:33:01.919><c> thing</c><00:33:02.000><c> that's</c><00:33:02.159><c> going</c>

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
is probably not the thing that's going
 

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.909 align:start position:0%
is probably not the thing that's going
to<00:33:02.320><c> win.</c><00:33:02.880><c> So</c><00:33:03.039><c> I'd</c><00:33:03.279><c> encourage</c><00:33:03.440><c> you</c><00:33:03.519><c> to</c><00:33:03.679><c> think</c><00:33:03.760><c> a</c>

00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
to win. So I'd encourage you to think a
 

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
to win. So I'd encourage you to think a

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
elsewhere, uh, and beyond. And so I

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
think you have to be very clear about
 

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.270 align:start position:0%
think you have to be very clear about
like<00:38:29.440><c> what</c><00:38:29.680><c> you're</c><00:38:29.920><c> trying</c><00:38:30.079><c> to</c><00:38:30.240><c> solve</c><00:38:30.480><c> for.</c>

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
like what you're trying to solve for.
 

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
like what you're trying to solve for.
But<00:38:31.760><c> yeah,</c><00:38:32.000><c> it's</c><00:38:32.160><c> a</c><00:38:32.400><c> maybe</c><00:38:32.640><c> a</c>

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
But yeah, it's a maybe a
 

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
But yeah, it's a maybe a

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.670 align:start position:0%

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
with thirdparty models and so that's
 

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.150 align:start position:0%

something<00:38:41.839><c> that</c><00:38:42.000><c> we</c><00:38:42.160><c> have</c><00:38:42.240><c> less</c><00:38:42.560><c> control</c><00:38:43.040><c> over</c>

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
you agree with or don't agree with. I

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
do that will increase. Um and I think it
 

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.109 align:start position:0%
do that will increase. Um and I think it
leads<00:40:06.720><c> to</c><00:40:07.520><c> some</c><00:40:08.000><c> uh</c><00:40:08.160><c> very</c><00:40:08.400><c> hard</c><00:40:08.640><c> to</c><00:40:08.800><c> wrestle</c>

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot about that. And then in
 

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.190 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot about that. And then in
