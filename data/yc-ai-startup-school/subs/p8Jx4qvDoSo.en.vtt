so uh how did I get to AI? Well, I I I
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
so uh how did I get to AI? Well, I I I
want<00:00:34.960><c> to</c><00:00:35.040><c> be</c><00:00:35.200><c> brief.</c><00:00:35.760><c> Why</c><00:00:36.000><c> did</c><00:00:36.160><c> I</c><00:00:36.320><c> start</c><00:00:36.480><c> in</c>

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
want to be brief. Why did I start in
 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
want to be brief. Why did I start in
physics?<00:00:37.360><c> It</c><00:00:37.600><c> was</c><00:00:37.680><c> basically</c><00:00:38.160><c> because</c><00:00:38.480><c> my</c><00:00:38.719><c> mom</c>

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
physics? It was basically because my mom
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.590 align:start position:0%
physics? It was basically because my mom
was<00:00:39.120><c> a</c><00:00:39.280><c> science</c><00:00:39.600><c> fiction</c><00:00:39.920><c> writer</c><00:00:40.640><c> and</c><00:00:41.120><c> I</c>

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
was a science fiction writer and I
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
was a science fiction writer and I
wanted<00:00:41.840><c> to</c><00:00:42.160><c> figure</c><00:00:42.480><c> out</c><00:00:42.640><c> if</c><00:00:42.879><c> we</c><00:00:43.120><c> could</c><00:00:43.280><c> build</c><00:00:43.680><c> a</c>

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to figure out if we could build a

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
faster than light drive and physics was
 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
faster than light drive and physics was
the<00:00:46.879><c> way</c><00:00:47.039><c> to</c><00:00:47.200><c> do</c><00:00:47.360><c> that.</c><00:00:48.160><c> Um</c><00:00:48.480><c> I</c><00:00:48.719><c> also</c><00:00:49.039><c> was</c><00:00:49.200><c> very</c>

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
the way to do that. Um I also was very
 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
the way to do that. Um I also was very

so<00:06:50.800><c> he</c><00:06:50.960><c> couldn't</c><00:06:51.199><c> study</c><00:06:51.440><c> AlphaGo,</c><00:06:52.080><c> that</c><00:06:52.240><c> was</c>

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
so he couldn't study AlphaGo, that was
 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.909 align:start position:0%
so he couldn't study AlphaGo, that was

I think it went unnoticed. I think

people didn't focus on this this sort of

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
kind of scaling behavior in RL soon
 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.589 align:start position:0%
kind of scaling behavior in RL soon
enough<00:07:52.319><c> but</c><00:07:52.479><c> but</c><00:07:52.800><c> eventually</c><00:07:53.120><c> it</c><00:07:53.280><c> came</c><00:07:53.440><c> to</c>

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
enough but but eventually it came to
 

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.390 align:start position:0%
enough but but eventually it came to
pass.<00:07:54.080><c> So</c><00:07:54.240><c> we</c><00:07:54.479><c> see</c><00:07:54.639><c> that</c><00:07:55.120><c> basically</c><00:07:55.599><c> you</c><00:07:55.840><c> can</c>

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
pass. So we see that basically you can
 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.749 align:start position:0%
pass. So we see that basically you can
scale<00:07:56.639><c> up</c><00:07:56.800><c> the</c><00:07:57.039><c> compute</c><00:07:57.280><c> in</c><00:07:57.520><c> both</c>

00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
scale up the compute in both
 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.070 align:start position:0%
scale up the compute in both
pre-training<00:07:58.400><c> and</c><00:07:58.639><c> RL</c><00:07:59.120><c> and</c><00:07:59.360><c> get</c><00:07:59.599><c> better</c><00:07:59.840><c> and</c>

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
pre-training and RL and get better and
 

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
pre-training and RL and get better and
better<00:08:00.319><c> performance.</c><00:08:01.199><c> And</c><00:08:01.360><c> I</c><00:08:01.520><c> think</c><00:08:01.599><c> that's</c>

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
I always recommend. One is I think it's
 

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
I always recommend. One is I think it's

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
really a good idea to build things that
 

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.670 align:start position:0%
really a good idea to build things that

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
always a good idea. We always want to
 

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
always a good idea. We always want to
have<00:13:57.040><c> ambition,</c><00:13:57.680><c> but</c><00:13:57.839><c> I</c><00:13:58.000><c> think</c><00:13:58.240><c> specifically</c>

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
have ambition, but I think specifically
 

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
have ambition, but I think specifically

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
will make that make that product work
 

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.710 align:start position:0%

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think that uh we'll be in trouble if
 

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.069 align:start position:0%
I think that uh we'll be in trouble if
it's<00:16:11.839><c> 12</c><00:16:12.079><c> months</c><00:16:12.399><c> before</c><00:16:12.880><c> before</c><00:16:13.600><c> an</c><00:16:13.839><c> even</c>

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
better model comes out. But uh I guess
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
better model comes out. But uh I guess
uh<00:16:17.360><c> a</c><00:16:17.600><c> few</c><00:16:17.759><c> things</c><00:16:18.000><c> with</c><00:16:18.160><c> with</c><00:16:18.480><c> Cloud</c><00:16:18.800><c> 4.</c><00:16:19.040><c> I</c>

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh a few things with with Cloud 4. I
 

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh a few things with with Cloud 4. I
think<00:16:19.279><c> that</c><00:16:20.000><c> with</c><00:16:20.240><c> Cloud</c><00:16:20.639><c> 3.7</c><00:16:21.279><c> Sonnet</c>

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
think that with Cloud 3.7 Sonnet
 

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.829 align:start position:0%
think that with Cloud 3.7 Sonnet
uh<00:16:23.040><c> it</c><00:16:23.279><c> was</c><00:16:23.440><c> already</c><00:16:23.759><c> really</c><00:16:24.079><c> exciting</c><00:16:24.399><c> to</c><00:16:24.720><c> use</c>

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh it was already really exciting to use
 

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh it was already really exciting to use
3.7<00:16:26.880><c> for</c><00:16:27.120><c> coding.</c><00:16:27.839><c> But</c><00:16:27.920><c> I</c><00:16:28.160><c> think</c><00:16:28.320><c> something</c>

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
3.7 for coding. But I think something
 

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.069 align:start position:0%
3.7 for coding. But I think something
that<00:16:28.800><c> everyone</c><00:16:29.199><c> noticed</c><00:16:29.920><c> was</c><00:16:30.160><c> that</c><00:16:30.880><c> 3.7</c><00:16:31.600><c> was</c><00:16:31.839><c> a</c>

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
that everyone noticed was that 3.7 was a
 

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.670 align:start position:0%
that everyone noticed was that 3.7 was a

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
little bit too eager. Um sometimes it
 

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
little bit too eager. Um sometimes it
just<00:16:35.839><c> really</c><00:16:36.160><c> wanted</c><00:16:36.399><c> to</c><00:16:36.639><c> make</c><00:16:36.959><c> your</c><00:16:37.279><c> tests</c>

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
just really wanted to make your tests
 

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.749 align:start position:0%
just really wanted to make your tests
pass.<00:16:38.399><c> Um</c><00:16:38.720><c> and</c><00:16:38.880><c> it</c><00:16:39.120><c> would</c><00:16:39.199><c> do</c><00:16:39.440><c> things</c><00:16:39.600><c> that</c>

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
pass. Um and it would do things that
 

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.749 align:start position:0%
pass. Um and it would do things that
that<00:16:40.079><c> you</c><00:16:40.160><c> you</c><00:16:40.399><c> don't</c><00:16:40.560><c> really</c><00:16:40.800><c> want.</c><00:16:41.279><c> Uh</c><00:16:41.600><c> there</c>

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
that you you don't really want. Uh there
 

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
that you you don't really want. Uh there
are a<00:16:41.920><c> lot</c><00:16:42.000><c> of</c><00:16:42.079><c> like</c><00:16:42.240><c> try</c><00:16:42.560><c> excepts</c><00:16:43.199><c> things</c>

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of like try excepts things
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
are a lot of like try excepts things
like<00:16:43.600><c> that.</c><00:16:44.240><c> Um,</c><00:16:45.279><c> so</c><00:16:45.680><c> with</c><00:16:45.920><c> Cloud</c><00:16:46.320><c> 4,</c><00:16:46.560><c> I</c><00:16:46.720><c> think</c>

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
like that. Um, so with Cloud 4, I think
 

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.829 align:start position:0%
like that. Um, so with Cloud 4, I think
that<00:16:47.040><c> we've</c><00:16:47.360><c> been</c><00:16:47.519><c> able</c><00:16:47.680><c> to</c><00:16:48.480><c> improve</c><00:16:49.600><c> the</c>

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%

finally<00:17:31.840><c> I</c><00:17:32.080><c> think</c><00:17:32.240><c> the</c><00:17:32.480><c> picture</c><00:17:32.640><c> that</c><00:17:32.880><c> scaling</c>

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
finally I think the picture that scaling
 

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.350 align:start position:0%
finally I think the picture that scaling

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
laws paint is one of incremental
 

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
laws paint is one of incremental
progress.<00:17:36.480><c> And</c><00:17:36.720><c> so</c><00:17:36.880><c> I</c><00:17:37.200><c> think</c><00:17:37.280><c> that</c><00:17:37.600><c> what</c>

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
progress. And so I think that what
 

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
progress. And so I think that what
you'll<00:17:38.160><c> see</c><00:17:38.480><c> with</c><00:17:39.120><c> Claude</c><00:17:39.520><c> is</c><00:17:39.679><c> that</c><00:17:40.000><c> steadily</c>

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see with Claude is that steadily
 

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.270 align:start position:0%
you'll see with Claude is that steadily
it<00:17:41.200><c> gets</c><00:17:41.440><c> better</c><00:17:41.679><c> in</c><00:17:42.000><c> lots</c><00:17:42.320><c> of</c><00:17:42.480><c> different</c><00:17:42.720><c> ways</c>

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
it gets better in lots of different ways
 

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
it gets better in lots of different ways

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
with each release. Um but I think that
 

00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:49.110 align:start position:0%
with each release. Um but I think that
scaling<00:17:46.640><c> really</c><00:17:47.039><c> suggests</c><00:17:47.520><c> a</c><00:17:47.760><c> kind</c><00:17:47.919><c> of</c><00:17:48.480><c> smooth</c>

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
scaling really suggests a kind of smooth

00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
AI is capable of. But I think that we're
 

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
AI is capable of. But I think that we're
sort<00:20:54.320><c> of</c><00:20:54.400><c> pushing</c><00:20:54.720><c> up</c><00:20:55.280><c> the</c><00:20:56.640><c> the</c><00:20:57.120><c> reliability</c>

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
sort of pushing up the the reliability
 

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.669 align:start position:0%
sort of pushing up the the reliability
as<00:20:59.520><c> well.</c><00:20:59.840><c> So</c><00:21:00.080><c> I</c><00:21:00.240><c> think</c><00:21:00.400><c> that</c><00:21:00.880><c> uh</c><00:21:01.120><c> we</c><00:21:01.360><c> will</c><00:21:01.520><c> see</c>

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
as well. So I think that uh we will see

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
more and more of these tasks. I think
 

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.710 align:start position:0%
more and more of these tasks. I think
that<00:21:03.760><c> uh</c><00:21:04.159><c> right</c><00:21:04.400><c> now</c><00:21:04.960><c> human</c><00:21:05.360><c> AI</c><00:21:05.760><c> collaboration</c>

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
that uh right now human AI collaboration
 

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
that uh right now human AI collaboration
is<00:21:07.840><c> is</c><00:21:08.320><c> going</c><00:21:08.480><c> to</c><00:21:08.640><c> be</c><00:21:08.799><c> the</c><00:21:09.200><c> sort</c><00:21:09.360><c> of</c><00:21:09.520><c> most</c>

already starting to happen. I guess an

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%

that<00:22:07.440><c> like</c><00:22:08.080><c> there</c><00:22:09.200><c> there's</c><00:22:09.520><c> sort</c><00:22:09.760><c> of</c>

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
that like there there's sort of
 

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
that like there there's sort of

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of breadth. So for
 

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of breadth. So for

there's there's really a lot to uh to

00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
for interpretability?
I<00:29:16.159><c> would</c><00:29:16.240><c> say</c><00:29:16.320><c> that</c><00:29:16.559><c> interpretability</c><00:29:17.279><c> is</c><00:29:17.440><c> a</c>

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
I would say that interpretability is a
 

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:19.350 align:start position:0%
I would say that interpretability is a

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.510 align:start position:0%
lot more like biology. It's a lot more

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
like neuroscience. So I think those are
 

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.909 align:start position:0%
like neuroscience. So I think those are
kind<00:29:21.679><c> of</c><00:29:21.760><c> the</c><00:29:21.919><c> tools.</c><00:29:22.720><c> Um</c><00:29:23.200><c> there</c><00:29:23.440><c> there</c><00:29:23.760><c> is</c>

00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
kind of the tools. Um there there is
 

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.389 align:start position:0%
kind of the tools. Um there there is
there<00:29:24.159><c> is</c><00:29:24.320><c> some</c><00:29:24.559><c> more</c><00:29:25.279><c> more</c><00:29:25.279><c> more</c><00:29:25.919><c> mathematics</c>

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
there is some more more more mathematics
 

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
there is some more more more mathematics
there.<00:29:26.799><c> But</c><00:29:26.880><c> I</c><00:29:26.960><c> I</c><00:29:27.200><c> think</c><00:29:27.279><c> it's</c><00:29:27.600><c> more</c><00:29:27.760><c> like</c>

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
there. But I I think it's more like
 

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.549 align:start position:0%
there. But I I think it's more like

I<00:30:09.360><c> think</c><00:30:09.440><c> it's</c><00:30:09.600><c> a</c><00:30:09.760><c> really</c><00:30:10.000><c> I</c><00:30:10.240><c> think</c><00:30:10.320><c> it's</c><00:30:10.480><c> a</c>

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really I think it's a
 

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.310 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really I think it's a

really hard question, right? Because I
 

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.230 align:start position:0%
really hard question, right? Because I
mostly<00:30:12.640><c> use</c><00:30:12.880><c> scaling</c><00:30:13.279><c> laws</c><00:30:13.520><c> to</c><00:30:13.760><c> diagnose</c>

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
mostly use scaling laws to diagnose
 

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.549 align:start position:0%
mostly use scaling laws to diagnose
whether<00:30:14.640><c> AI</c><00:30:15.039><c> training</c><00:30:15.360><c> is</c><00:30:15.679><c> broken</c><00:30:16.080><c> or</c><00:30:16.240><c> not.</c>

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%

Mh.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.990 align:start position:0%

So<00:30:17.039><c> I</c><00:30:17.279><c> think</c><00:30:17.360><c> that</c><00:30:18.240><c> uh</c><00:30:19.279><c> once</c><00:30:19.600><c> you</c><00:30:19.760><c> see</c>

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
So I think that uh once you see
 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.909 align:start position:0%
So I think that uh once you see
something<00:30:20.320><c> and</c><00:30:20.559><c> you</c><00:30:20.720><c> find</c><00:30:20.880><c> it</c><00:30:21.039><c> very</c><00:30:21.520><c> it's</c><00:30:21.760><c> a</c>

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
something and you find it very it's a
 

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.310 align:start position:0%
something and you find it very it's a
very<00:30:22.080><c> compelling</c><00:30:22.559><c> trend,</c><00:30:23.440><c> it</c><00:30:23.760><c> becomes</c><00:30:24.080><c> very</c>

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
very compelling trend, it becomes very
 

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.190 align:start position:0%
very compelling trend, it becomes very
very<00:30:24.720><c> interesting</c><00:30:25.360><c> to</c><00:30:25.679><c> examine</c>

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
very interesting to examine
 

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
very interesting to examine
where<00:30:27.520><c> it's</c><00:30:27.760><c> failing.</c><00:30:28.640><c> But</c><00:30:28.799><c> I</c><00:30:28.960><c> think</c><00:30:29.039><c> that</c><00:30:29.200><c> my</c>

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
where it's failing. But I think that my
 

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.389 align:start position:0%
where it's failing. But I think that my
first<00:30:29.679><c> inclination</c><00:30:30.320><c> is</c><00:30:30.559><c> to</c><00:30:30.799><c> think</c><00:30:31.520><c> if</c><00:30:32.000><c> scaling</c>

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
first inclination is to think if scaling
 

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:34.789 align:start position:0%
first inclination is to think if scaling
laws<00:30:32.720><c> are</c><00:30:32.880><c> failing,</c><00:30:33.279><c> it's</c><00:30:33.600><c> because</c><00:30:34.320><c> we've</c>

00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
laws are failing, it's because we've
 

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.789 align:start position:0%
laws are failing, it's because we've
screwed<00:30:35.120><c> up</c><00:30:35.520><c> AI</c><00:30:35.919><c> training</c><00:30:36.240><c> in</c><00:30:36.399><c> some</c><00:30:36.559><c> way.</c>

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
screwed up AI training in some way.
 

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.669 align:start position:0%
screwed up AI training in some way.

don't see or there's some problem with

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
precision in the algorithms that we're
using.<00:30:48.320><c> So</c><00:30:48.880><c> I</c><00:30:49.120><c> think</c><00:30:49.200><c> it</c><00:30:49.440><c> would</c><00:30:49.600><c> take</c><00:30:49.760><c> a</c><00:30:50.000><c> lot</c><00:30:50.799><c> to</c>

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.070 align:start position:0%

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
convince me at least that scaling was
 

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
convince me at least that scaling was

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
was broken it was because we were doing
 

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
was broken it was because we were doing
it<00:31:04.000><c> wrong.</c>

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
it wrong.
 

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.549 align:start position:0%
it wrong.
Interesting.<00:31:05.279><c> So</c><00:31:05.600><c> I</c><00:31:05.840><c> guess</c><00:31:06.000><c> going</c><00:31:06.240><c> into</c>

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
Interesting. So I guess going into
 

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.310 align:start position:0%
Interesting. So I guess going into
something<00:31:06.799><c> very</c><00:31:07.120><c> specific</c><00:31:07.600><c> that</c><00:31:07.840><c> goes</c><00:31:08.080><c> hand</c>

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
something very specific that goes hand
 

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.710 align:start position:0%
something very specific that goes hand
in<00:31:08.559><c> hand</c><00:31:08.880><c> is</c><00:31:09.120><c> a</c><00:31:09.360><c> lot</c><00:31:09.440><c> of</c><00:31:09.600><c> the</c><00:31:09.760><c> compute</c><00:31:10.159><c> power</c>

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
in hand is a lot of the compute power
 

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.070 align:start position:0%
in hand is a lot of the compute power
required<00:31:11.360><c> to</c><00:31:12.080><c> go</c><00:31:12.399><c> keep</c><00:31:12.640><c> going</c><00:31:12.880><c> on</c><00:31:13.039><c> this</c><00:31:13.279><c> curve.</c>

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
required to go keep going on this curve.
 

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.430 align:start position:0%
required to go keep going on this curve.
What<00:31:14.399><c> happens</c><00:31:15.039><c> uh</c><00:31:15.520><c> as</c><00:31:15.840><c> compute</c><00:31:16.240><c> becomes</c><00:31:16.559><c> more</c>

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
What happens uh as compute becomes more

to get computers back into binary. So I
 

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.149 align:start position:0%
to get computers back into binary. So I

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
ask you like why do you think that
 

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
ask you like why do you think that
suddenly<00:35:47.200><c> on</c><00:35:47.359><c> this</c><00:35:47.520><c> chart</c><00:35:47.839><c> we're</c><00:35:48.079><c> exponential</c>

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
suddenly on this chart we're exponential
 

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.950 align:start position:0%
suddenly on this chart we're exponential
and<00:35:48.880><c> not</c><00:35:49.040><c> linear</c><00:35:49.440><c> anymore?</c>

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
and not linear anymore?
 

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.069 align:start position:0%
and not linear anymore?

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
Yeah, this is a really good question and
 

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
Yeah, this is a really good question and
I<00:35:53.920><c> don't</c><00:35:54.079><c> know.</c><00:35:54.560><c> Um</c><00:35:55.200><c> I</c><00:35:55.440><c> mean</c><00:35:55.599><c> the</c><00:35:55.760><c> meter</c>

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know. Um I mean the meter
 

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.310 align:start position:0%
I don't know. Um I mean the meter
finding<00:35:57.119><c> was</c><00:35:57.440><c> kind</c><00:35:57.520><c> of</c><00:35:57.599><c> an</c><00:35:57.839><c> empirical</c>

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
finding was kind of an empirical
 

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.190 align:start position:0%
finding was kind of an empirical

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
finding. Um the way that I tend to think
 

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.310 align:start position:0%
finding. Um the way that I tend to think
about<00:36:01.359><c> this</c><00:36:01.520><c> is</c><00:36:01.760><c> that</c><00:36:02.320><c> um</c><00:36:03.599><c> in</c><00:36:03.839><c> order</c><00:36:04.000><c> to</c><00:36:04.160><c> do</c>

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
about this is that um in order to do
 

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
about this is that um in order to do

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
you've you make a plan and then you
 

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.950 align:start position:0%
you've you make a plan and then you
start<00:36:15.680><c> executing</c><00:36:16.000><c> in</c><00:36:16.160><c> the</c><00:36:16.320><c> plan.</c><00:36:16.800><c> But</c>

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
start executing in the plan. But
 

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.630 align:start position:0%
start executing in the plan. But
everyone<00:36:17.280><c> knows</c><00:36:17.520><c> that</c><00:36:17.760><c> our</c><00:36:18.000><c> plans</c><00:36:18.320><c> are</c><00:36:18.480><c> kind</c>

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that our plans are kind
 

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that our plans are kind
of<00:36:18.800><c> worthless</c><00:36:19.680><c> and</c><00:36:20.640><c> uh</c><00:36:20.880><c> and</c><00:36:21.119><c> we</c><00:36:21.359><c> encounter</c>

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
of worthless and uh and we encounter
 

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
of worthless and uh and we encounter
reality.<00:36:22.400><c> we</c><00:36:22.640><c> get</c><00:36:22.800><c> things</c><00:36:23.040><c> wrong.</c><00:36:23.680><c> And</c><00:36:23.920><c> so</c><00:36:24.400><c> I</c>

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
reality. we get things wrong. And so I
 

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.230 align:start position:0%
reality. we get things wrong. And so I
think<00:36:24.720><c> that</c><00:36:24.880><c> a</c><00:36:25.119><c> lot</c><00:36:25.200><c> of</c><00:36:25.359><c> what</c><00:36:25.520><c> determines</c><00:36:26.000><c> the</c>

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of what determines the
 

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of what determines the
horizon<00:36:26.720><c> length</c><00:36:27.119><c> of</c><00:36:27.280><c> what</c><00:36:27.760><c> models</c><00:36:28.160><c> can</c>

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
horizon length of what models can
 

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.230 align:start position:0%
horizon length of what models can
accomplish<00:36:29.040><c> is</c><00:36:29.280><c> their</c><00:36:29.520><c> ability</c><00:36:29.760><c> to</c><00:36:30.000><c> notice</c>

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish is their ability to notice
 

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
accomplish is their ability to notice
that<00:36:30.480><c> they're</c><00:36:30.640><c> doing</c><00:36:30.880><c> something</c><00:36:31.200><c> wrong</c><00:36:31.920><c> and</c>

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
that they're doing something wrong and
 

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
that they're doing something wrong and
and<00:36:32.640><c> correct</c><00:36:32.960><c> it.</c><00:36:33.599><c> Um,</c><00:36:34.000><c> and</c><00:36:34.240><c> I</c><00:36:34.400><c> think</c><00:36:34.480><c> that's</c>

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
and correct it. Um, and I think that's
 

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
and correct it. Um, and I think that's

fix your mistake, maybe you sort of on

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
of getting stuck here, you get stuck
 

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
of getting stuck here, you get stuck

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
kind of ability to understand the task
and<00:37:07.119><c> self-correct.</c><00:37:08.240><c> But</c><00:37:08.320><c> that</c><00:37:08.560><c> just</c><00:37:08.800><c> kind</c><00:37:08.880><c> of</c>

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
and self-correct. But that just kind of
 

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
and self-correct. But that just kind of
like<00:37:09.520><c> those</c><00:37:09.760><c> are</c><00:37:09.920><c> just</c><00:37:10.160><c> words.</c><00:37:10.880><c> I</c><00:37:11.119><c> think</c><00:37:11.200><c> the</c>

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
like those are just words. I think the
 

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
like those are just words. I think the

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
interesting thing. And uh maybe we can

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
build more detailed models for why that
 

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
build more detailed models for why that
trend<00:37:18.240><c> is</c><00:37:18.480><c> true,</c><00:37:18.800><c> but</c><00:37:19.200><c> it's</c><00:37:19.520><c> sort</c><00:37:19.680><c> of</c><00:37:19.839><c> your</c>

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
trend is true, but it's sort of your
 

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
trend is true, but it's sort of your
guess<00:37:20.160><c> is</c><00:37:20.320><c> as</c><00:37:20.560><c> good</c><00:37:20.640><c> as</c><00:37:20.800><c> mine.</c>

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
guess is as good as mine.
 

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.069 align:start position:0%
guess is as good as mine.
Yeah.<00:37:22.320><c> So</c><00:37:22.560><c> I</c><00:37:22.880><c> also</c><00:37:23.119><c> have</c><00:37:23.200><c> a</c><00:37:23.359><c> question</c><00:37:23.760><c> over</c>

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
Yeah. So I also have a question over
 

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:26.310 align:start position:0%
Yeah. So I also have a question over
here.<00:37:24.560><c> Um</c><00:37:24.800><c> so</c><00:37:24.960><c> it's</c><00:37:25.119><c> an</c><00:37:25.520><c> honor.</c><00:37:25.920><c> Um</c><00:37:26.160><c> so</c>

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
here. Um so it's an honor. Um so
 

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
here. Um so it's an honor. Um so
basically<00:37:26.960><c> um</c><00:37:27.119><c> in</c><00:37:27.359><c> terms</c><00:37:27.520><c> of</c><00:37:28.079><c> um</c><00:37:28.640><c> increasing</c>

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
basically um in terms of um increasing
 

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
basically um in terms of um increasing
the<00:37:29.359><c> time</c><00:37:29.599><c> horizon,</c><00:37:30.400><c> I</c><00:37:30.640><c> feel</c><00:37:30.800><c> like</c><00:37:31.040><c> so</c><00:37:31.200><c> my</c>

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
the time horizon, I feel like so my
 

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.710 align:start position:0%
the time horizon, I feel like so my
mental<00:37:31.680><c> model</c><00:37:31.839><c> of</c><00:37:32.000><c> neuronet</c><00:37:32.320><c> networks</c><00:37:32.560><c> is</c>

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
mental model of neuronet networks is
 

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.069 align:start position:0%
mental model of neuronet networks is
very<00:37:32.960><c> simple.</c><00:37:33.200><c> If</c><00:37:33.359><c> you</c><00:37:33.520><c> want</c><00:37:33.599><c> them</c><00:37:33.760><c> to</c><00:37:33.920><c> do</c>

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
very simple. If you want them to do
 

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
very simple. If you want them to do
something,<00:37:34.480><c> you</c><00:37:34.720><c> train</c><00:37:34.960><c> on</c><00:37:35.520><c> such</c><00:37:35.760><c> data.</c><00:37:36.560><c> Um</c><00:37:36.880><c> so</c>

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
something, you train on such data. Um so
 

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.190 align:start position:0%
something, you train on such data. Um so
if<00:37:37.200><c> you</c><00:37:37.359><c> want</c><00:37:37.520><c> them</c><00:37:37.839><c> to</c><00:37:38.320><c> um</c><00:37:38.480><c> if</c><00:37:38.720><c> you</c><00:37:38.880><c> want</c><00:37:38.960><c> to</c>

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
if you want them to um if you want to
 

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.270 align:start position:0%
if you want them to um if you want to
increase<00:37:39.440><c> the</c><00:37:39.839><c> um</c><00:37:39.920><c> time</c><00:37:40.160><c> horizon</c><00:37:40.560><c> you</c><00:37:40.720><c> have</c><00:37:40.880><c> to</c>

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
increase the um time horizon you have to
 

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.790 align:start position:0%
increase the um time horizon you have to
slowly<00:37:41.680><c> get</c><00:37:41.839><c> for</c><00:37:42.000><c> example</c><00:37:42.320><c> verification</c>

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
slowly get for example verification
 

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
slowly get for example verification
signals.<00:37:43.680><c> Now</c><00:37:44.160><c> um</c><00:37:44.240><c> I</c><00:37:44.480><c> think</c><00:37:44.560><c> one</c><00:37:44.800><c> way</c><00:37:44.960><c> to</c><00:37:45.119><c> do</c>

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
signals. Now um I think one way to do
 

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
signals. Now um I think one way to do
this<00:37:45.359><c> is</c><00:37:45.520><c> via</c><00:37:45.920><c> product.</c><00:37:46.160><c> So</c><00:37:46.320><c> like</c><00:37:46.560><c> for</c><00:37:46.640><c> example</c>

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is via product. So like for example
 

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.870 align:start position:0%
this is via product. So like for example
um<00:37:47.359><c> cloud</c><00:37:47.760><c> agent</c><00:37:48.079><c> and</c><00:37:48.240><c> then</c><00:37:48.400><c> you</c><00:37:48.640><c> use</c><00:37:48.720><c> the</c>

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
um cloud agent and then you use the
 

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
um cloud agent and then you use the
verification<00:37:49.359><c> signal</c><00:37:49.680><c> to</c><00:37:49.839><c> incrementally</c>

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
verification signal to incrementally
 

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.550 align:start position:0%
verification signal to incrementally
improve<00:37:50.720><c> the</c><00:37:51.119><c> model.</c><00:37:51.680><c> Now</c><00:37:51.920><c> my</c><00:37:52.079><c> question</c><00:37:52.320><c> is</c>

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
improve the model. Now my question is
 

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.310 align:start position:0%
improve the model. Now my question is
basically<00:37:53.040><c> this</c><00:37:53.359><c> works</c><00:37:53.599><c> really</c><00:37:53.839><c> nicely</c><00:37:54.079><c> for</c>

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
basically this works really nicely for
 

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.069 align:start position:0%
basically this works really nicely for
for<00:37:54.480><c> example</c><00:37:54.800><c> coding</c><00:37:55.520><c> where</c><00:37:55.680><c> you</c><00:37:55.839><c> have</c><00:37:55.920><c> a</c>

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
for example coding where you have a
 

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
for example coding where you have a
product<00:37:56.240><c> that</c><00:37:56.480><c> is</c><00:37:56.560><c> sufficiently</c><00:37:56.960><c> good</c><00:37:57.200><c> such</c>

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
product that is sufficiently good such
 

00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
product that is sufficiently good such
that<00:37:57.520><c> you</c><00:37:57.680><c> can</c><00:37:57.839><c> deploy</c><00:37:58.079><c> it</c><00:37:58.240><c> and</c><00:37:58.480><c> then</c><00:37:59.200><c> get</c><00:37:59.359><c> the</c>

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that you can deploy it and then get the
 

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.270 align:start position:0%
that you can deploy it and then get the
verification<00:38:00.000><c> signal</c><00:38:00.400><c> but</c><00:38:00.640><c> what</c><00:38:00.800><c> about</c><00:38:01.040><c> other</c>

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
verification signal but what about other
 

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
verification signal but what about other
domains<00:38:01.920><c> like</c><00:38:02.160><c> in</c><00:38:02.400><c> other</c><00:38:02.560><c> domains</c><00:38:02.880><c> are</c><00:38:03.119><c> we</c>

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
domains like in other domains are we
 

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.870 align:start position:0%
domains like in other domains are we
just<00:38:03.760><c> um</c><00:38:04.400><c> scaling</c><00:38:04.800><c> data</c><00:38:05.040><c> labelers</c><00:38:05.520><c> to</c><00:38:05.599><c> AGI</c><00:38:06.240><c> or</c>

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
just um scaling data labelers to AGI or
 

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
just um scaling data labelers to AGI or
is<00:38:07.040><c> there</c><00:38:07.200><c> a</c><00:38:07.359><c> better</c><00:38:07.599><c> approach?</c><00:38:08.480><c> Yeah,</c><00:38:08.800><c> it's</c><00:38:08.960><c> a</c>

00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
is there a better approach? Yeah, it's a
 

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:13.109 align:start position:0%
is there a better approach? Yeah, it's a
good<00:38:09.280><c> question.</c><00:38:09.680><c> I</c><00:38:09.920><c> mean,</c><00:38:10.640><c> um,</c><00:38:11.440><c> so</c><00:38:12.480><c> when</c><00:38:12.720><c> when</c>

00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
good question. I mean, um, so when when
 

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
good question. I mean, um, so when when
sort<00:38:13.359><c> of</c><00:38:14.400><c> skeptics</c><00:38:14.960><c> ask</c><00:38:15.280><c> me</c><00:38:15.599><c> sort</c><00:38:15.839><c> of</c><00:38:16.079><c> why</c><00:38:16.880><c> do</c><00:38:17.040><c> I</c>

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
sort of skeptics ask me sort of why do I
 

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.069 align:start position:0%
sort of skeptics ask me sort of why do I
think<00:38:17.599><c> we</c><00:38:17.920><c> will</c><00:38:18.240><c> be</c><00:38:18.400><c> able</c><00:38:18.640><c> to</c><00:38:18.960><c> sort</c><00:38:19.200><c> of</c><00:38:19.760><c> scale</c>

00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
think we will be able to sort of scale
 

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
think we will be able to sort of scale
and<00:38:20.320><c> get</c><00:38:20.560><c> something</c><00:38:20.880><c> like</c><00:38:21.200><c> broadly</c><00:38:21.599><c> human</c>

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
and get something like broadly human
 

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.870 align:start position:0%

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this to some extent.
 

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:53.349 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this to some extent.
We'll<00:39:51.280><c> do</c><00:39:51.599><c> one</c><00:39:51.760><c> last</c><00:39:52.000><c> question.</c>

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
We'll do one last question.
 

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:55.430 align:start position:0%
We'll do one last question.
Yeah,<00:39:53.599><c> I</c><00:39:53.920><c> wanted</c><00:39:54.160><c> to</c><00:39:54.320><c> build</c><00:39:54.560><c> on</c><00:39:54.800><c> top</c><00:39:54.960><c> of</c><00:39:55.119><c> that.</c>

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I wanted to build on top of that.
 

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I wanted to build on top of that.
when<00:39:55.680><c> you're</c><00:39:55.920><c> basically</c><00:39:56.480><c> developing</c><00:39:57.040><c> like</c>

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
when you're basically developing like
 

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
when you're basically developing like
these<00:39:57.599><c> tasks</c><00:39:58.240><c> and</c><00:39:58.480><c> then</c><00:39:58.720><c> training</c><00:39:59.040><c> them</c><00:39:59.200><c> with</c>

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
these tasks and then training them with
 

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.470 align:start position:0%
these tasks and then training them with

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
RL, would are you like like would you
 

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
RL, would are you like like would you
like<00:40:02.800><c> try</c><00:40:03.119><c> creating</c><00:40:03.520><c> these</c><00:40:03.839><c> tasks</c><00:40:04.240><c> like</c><00:40:04.480><c> using</c>

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
like try creating these tasks like using
 

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
like try creating these tasks like using
large<00:40:05.200><c> language</c><00:40:05.680><c> models</c><00:40:06.320><c> like</c><00:40:06.560><c> the</c><00:40:06.720><c> tasks</c><00:40:07.040><c> you</c>

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
large language models like the tasks you
 

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
large language models like the tasks you
use<00:40:07.440><c> for</c><00:40:07.680><c> RL</c><00:40:08.000><c> or</c><00:40:08.240><c> are</c><00:40:08.400><c> you</c><00:40:08.480><c> still</c><00:40:08.720><c> using</c>

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
use for RL or are you still using
 

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:09.990 align:start position:0%
use for RL or are you still using
humans?

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
humans?
 

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.030 align:start position:0%
humans?
Great<00:40:10.320><c> question.</c><00:40:10.800><c> So</c><00:40:11.280><c> I</c><00:40:11.520><c> would</c><00:40:11.599><c> say</c><00:40:11.760><c> a</c><00:40:12.000><c> mix.</c><00:40:12.400><c> Um</c>

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
Great question. So I would say a mix. Um
 

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
Great question. So I would say a mix. Um
I<00:40:13.280><c> mean</c><00:40:13.440><c> obviously</c><00:40:13.920><c> we're</c><00:40:14.160><c> building</c><00:40:14.320><c> the</c>

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously we're building the
 

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously we're building the
tasks<00:40:14.800><c> as</c><00:40:15.040><c> much</c><00:40:15.200><c> as</c><00:40:15.359><c> possible</c><00:40:15.839><c> using</c><00:40:16.240><c> AI</c><00:40:17.040><c> to</c>

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
tasks as much as possible using AI to
 

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
tasks as much as possible using AI to
sort<00:40:17.440><c> of</c><00:40:17.599><c> like</c><00:40:18.880><c> say</c><00:40:19.280><c> generate</c><00:40:19.760><c> tasks</c><00:40:20.240><c> with</c>

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
sort of like say generate tasks with
 

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
sort of like say generate tasks with
code.<00:40:21.200><c> we</c><00:40:21.520><c> do</c><00:40:22.079><c> like</c><00:40:22.720><c> also</c><00:40:23.920><c> uh</c><00:40:24.240><c> ask</c><00:40:24.560><c> humans</c><00:40:24.880><c> to</c>

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
code. we do like also uh ask humans to
 

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.109 align:start position:0%
code. we do like also uh ask humans to
create<00:40:25.280><c> tasks.</c><00:40:26.079><c> So</c><00:40:26.240><c> it's</c><00:40:26.400><c> it's</c><00:40:26.720><c> basically</c>

00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
create tasks. So it's it's basically
 

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.670 align:start position:0%
create tasks. So it's it's basically
some<00:40:27.359><c> mixture</c><00:40:27.680><c> of</c><00:40:27.839><c> those</c><00:40:28.079><c> things.</c><00:40:28.880><c> Um</c><00:40:29.200><c> I</c><00:40:29.520><c> think</c>

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
some mixture of those things. Um I think
 

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
some mixture of those things. Um I think
that<00:40:30.160><c> as</c><00:40:30.480><c> AI</c><00:40:30.880><c> gets</c><00:40:31.119><c> better</c><00:40:31.359><c> and</c><00:40:31.520><c> better,</c>

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
that as AI gets better and better,
 

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
that as AI gets better and better,
hopefully<00:40:32.240><c> we're</c><00:40:32.400><c> able</c><00:40:32.560><c> to</c><00:40:32.720><c> leverage</c><00:40:32.960><c> AI</c><00:40:33.280><c> more</c>

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're able to leverage AI more
 

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're able to leverage AI more
and<00:40:33.599><c> more,</c><00:40:33.680><c> but</c><00:40:33.920><c> of</c><00:40:34.079><c> course</c><00:40:34.160><c> the</c><00:40:34.320><c> frontier</c><00:40:35.040><c> of</c>

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
and more, but of course the frontier of
 

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
and more, but of course the frontier of
the<00:40:35.520><c> difficulty</c><00:40:35.920><c> of</c><00:40:36.079><c> these</c><00:40:36.320><c> tasks</c><00:40:36.720><c> also</c>

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of these tasks also
 

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.589 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of these tasks also
increases.<00:40:37.680><c> So</c><00:40:38.079><c> I</c><00:40:38.320><c> think</c><00:40:38.480><c> humans</c><00:40:38.880><c> are</c><00:40:38.960><c> are</c><00:40:39.040><c> are</c>

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
increases. So I think humans are are are
 

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
increases. So I think humans are are are
still<00:40:39.760><c> going</c><00:40:39.839><c> to</c><00:40:39.920><c> be</c><00:40:40.079><c> involved.</c>

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
still going to be involved.
 

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
still going to be involved.
Okay.<00:40:41.119><c> Thank</c><00:40:41.280><c> you.</c>

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
Okay. Thank you.
 

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
Okay. Thank you.
All right.<00:40:42.400><c> Let's</c><00:40:42.720><c> give</c><00:40:42.800><c> it</c><00:40:42.960><c> a</c><00:40:43.040><c> round</c><00:40:43.280><c> of</c>

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
All right. Let's give it a round of
 

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.510 align:start position:0%
All right. Let's give it a round of
applause<00:40:43.680><c> to</c><00:40:43.839><c> Jared.</c>

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
