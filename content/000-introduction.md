# Introduction

This eBook compiles talks from YCâ€™s AI Startup School, organized as one chapter per speaker. Each chapter includes the speaker, talk title, and transcript, with links back to the original source when available.

Use this as a placeholder preface. It will remain as Chapter 0; all talks will follow in numbered order.
